Who will provide the service after sales?,"I have purchased Samsung A8+ on 12th Oct and the return window was showing as ""closed 22 Oct 2018"".

Then, the mobile showing- Encryption problem"". I have submitted to the Samsung service centre along with invoices and they told that- ""it may be happen due to the interruption of updates"" and it takes 4-5 days to come to a decision.
I would like to draw your attention that, the phone simply become dead when I switched off.
Since it was purchased ""ONLINE"" through Amazon, who will give the immediate support? The service centre is mentioning the lengthy procedure for which I have no time because I am travelling to Germany and France on 27th Oct. Usually, the return duration shall be one month on Amazon. Why it was closed in 10 days?
It was a new piece and for simple reason, the phone was dead which was a manufacturing defect.

Mobile with great potential but with little bit of compromise,"I am using this model for just over 1 month. Here is my experience with this phone.
Pros:
1. It is smooth. Like really smooth performance it has got. With 6 gb ram and exynos 7885 octa core processor it is like a flagship.
2. The display. Super amoled display is always crisp and great and it has the same.
3. Fast charging. It really does the trick. To get from 2% to 100% charge it takes about 1 hour.
4. It is splash proof. To test I have splashed a whole mug of water on the phone. It is fine as promised.
5. Stunning look. It has glass on both side and the look and feel of the model is awesome. People often will think about it as Galaxy note 8.
6. Dual VOLTE. It has dual VOLTE support. That means if you are using one jio sim and other vodafone/airtel, you can use data from Vodafone/airtel and still Jio will be working.
7. Dedicated sd slot. It has 2 sim slots and one dedicated micro sd card slot.
8. It is Dolby supported. So if you have a good headset you will get very good and clear sound.
Cons:
1. Battery could have been better. With 6"" display and super amoled it lasts about 10 hours with heavy usage.
2. No front flash. Dual camera is present on the front so you will get the boke mode.
3. No dual camera on the rear. At this price range it should have been provided.
4. Sometime the phone feels heavy a bit. It is over 190gms.
Verdict: If camera is not your first priority, great performance with little bit of compromise with battery is not an issue for you you can surely go for it. I bought it on sale @Rs.21000+ and it is worth that.",Rajdeep Bhattacharjee,12 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Superb phone !,"Let me start by saying that there are better phones in this price segment. But, if you find this phone in less than or around 20k just go for it. Its a flagship like feel. Build quality and battery life is super. Screen is just what you need. Its a Amoled display which meets expectations. Sound wise performance is superb ( Dolby support). Signal quality you can't complain about. Now, average or below average part is its camera. In daylight condition its quite good, but in poor lighting conditions it totally fails. Like a Mi phone of 10k performs better than it. This is the only downside i felt. I have been using it for now more than a month. I purchased it for 18k during tbe big billion days offers. A lot of people complain about it fingerprint sensor, let me say that it is very fast. And also the face unlock feature is not bad. It performs in low light conditions as well. I swear to it. Overall if you are normal user and not than much photogenic or selfie freak you are not going to regret it. Its a good phone after all. I am totally safisfied with it. It only there would have been wireless charging support it would be a killer.",Sumit K. Singh,25 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Very Nice and sturdy phone,"Screensize - 5 star
Sound- with powerful speakers the output is really good.
Performance- with 6GB RAM and a powerful processor, the performance is quite good in all respects, except that the fingerprint works a bit slower. Face recognition is not so good.
Storage - 64 GB is awesome.
weight - Its a bit heavy phone as compared to other competitors.
Battery - Fast charging - 70 min to fully charge and battery lasts for more than 24 hrs even with quite extensive internet usage.
Price - Amazon sale gave a decent price and hence overall the phone is very good",Pankaj Singh,29 October 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Display Screen issues,"Within a week of usage of new SAMSUNG Galaxy A8, display was having issues. Lines started to appear.

Price is 2 high,Samsung a 8 plus price is to high,Amazon Customer,26 August 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars
Best alternative to over priced Samsung S and Note Series,"Almost 80-90% features of its costlier siblings in much pocket friendly rates.
Superb water resistannce.
Amazing sound quality.
Doesn't have front flash for some unfathomable reasons, have to make do with screen flash , which btw is sufficient.
Good primary camera for daylight and low light photography.
Phone warms up a little during outdoor usage.
Display quality is just great for this price tag.
Battery easily last for 10-12 on average usage and around 18-20 hrs on conservative use.
Some cool features like samsung health, Bixby, Samsung pay, knox security folder.
All in all a great and pocket friendly utility device.
Would recommend to anybody who wants a ""smart"" phone.",Utkarsh Kalmegh,22 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
All round phone. Deserves 3.5-4 star.,"I grabbed it on the Diwali Sale. For that price, I felt the product is fantastic. This was a tough choice because there's a lot offered and some things missing. The build is super. Fingerprint magnet but feels very premium to look and hold. The processor performs well too. I expected tad bit better performance. Gaming is a 3.5/5. Daily use is very good. It delivers without making you wait. It is snappy for daily activities. Music is good. The sound is pretty loud from the speaker. Quality is appreciable. Dolby does a good job on earphones over Bluetooth or 3.5mm jack. Fast charging is sweet. Fills it up in no time. An hour worth of charge is always enough for me ( > 80% ). Cameras are okayish. Daylight pics are very good. Natural looking photos. Bit saturated. Photos clicked in relatively dark or artificial lighting environment have minimal noise which can be figured out when zoomed in. The Samsung features which have been brought from the elder ones are nice. Some are plain bloatware. But Samsung Pay is great. Bixby too. For me it was a 4.5/5 because of the deal. Very happy.",Amazon Customer,11 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Great for 2 Sims and dedicated memory,"This is a great phone if you are having two Sims and want to use a dedicated memory card. Most dual SIM phone go slow queen you user them overtime. This phone which is on the latest android and huge battery, provide enough juice for minimum 2 days. Good camera, good speakers, great battery. Easy fit in hand for one hand usage.
Also the phone came at less than 50% of the value when I got this during the Great Indian Festival.",Benoy M.,13 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent quality as expected from samsung,"Samsung phones simply refuse to die. I have never purchased a Samsung smart ph which is still not in use starting with the Samsung wave 1, S3, S4, Core 2 etc. All my other makes including Apple are lying dead in the drawers. Going by the excellent build quality, display and camera on this one, I have no doubt this too will maintain the reputation.
It's not as fancy as the notched Vivo etc phs but the quality of integration and build quality is way way ahead.",Amazon Customer,25 October 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
A budget buy with a class,"Don't compare this product with cheap China products. It has many more hidden features which you won't find in cheap products like other China one. Like ip68 rating, credit card swipe feature best quality super AMOLED screen and many more. There is a class in the product itself without trust of the brand. You can go for it blindly.",Ujjwal Chetan,29 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Never miss (if u r a normal user/ office worker),"After one month of usage, its the best for me.(i am not a hardcore gamer). Camera and picture quality is good . Sound is also better.
The earphone provided was decent.
Above all it looks premium in hand.
Battery life is average (hardly one day for normal usage )
I like Samsungs UI .
Position of the fingerprint scanner is ergonomic and the notification panel can be scrolled down scrolling down the fingerprint scanner. (I found it helpful)

Average mobile.,"Not very pleased with the rear camera .
And also there is no led light in front for selfie.
So if you want to take selfies in night in low light it is a nightmare for you.
Rear camera is not satisfactory and disappointing by such a brand .
Overall other features are intresting although with old processor performance is good .

Bugs!,Phone is good but a lot of bugs came in just 2 days. My SIM card is stopped working in this phone. Messages are sending automatically to some unknown people. Front camera is good but rear camera is not that good. Focus of rear camera is really bad. Even it's not blurring image. Phone is quite heavy. Battery life is good. But I don't know where that bugs came from. Even I didn't used internet on first day but there were some bugs in it. Is that bugs came from Amazon??,Suhail s.,9 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars

This mobile taking almost 3 hours to full charge the mobile.
After factory restore, still this mobile takes 2 plus hours to full charge.
Another big issue is network problem.
I heard almost every time that your voice is cutting or not clear.
Previously i used Samsung J7 prime in same room, same office, same home. same city but never faced network problem.
But with this product i am facing network problem.
Ever i talked with customer care (before 10 days return/refund date i.e. 27th October, he said just do factory data reset, and use mobile for next 2 days, if same proble Occurs, than we will change your product.
Next ti.e while i talked with customer care he told me to our app and check all the parameters, but 2 times while i tries for check the same, this mobile didn't connect to Mobile data, while talking with somebody.
Kindly solve my issue. Replace or return the product.
Why should i face this problem.
May be my wrong decesion that i trust on Amazon.
But totally unsatisfied with the product i received.

Absolutely great,"Absolutely great smartphone, first thing first great battery backup, good camera performance except in low-light but front cam is good all around especially the live focus. Haven't tested the waterproofing yet, display is great as always with Samsung, fast enough, hasn't hanged yet with almost 90+ apps installed, big size easily adaptable in just couple of days. The fingerprint sensor is slightly slower only when compared to other smartphones, on its own it performs admirably. Notification LED working as expected, primary colours are good but secondary colours are not very accurate, not a deal breaker but some things matter. It comes with a good quality transparent hard plastic cover, Good earphones and fast charger in the box",Bharath Kumar,17 June 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome phone from most reliable brand,"The phone is awesome, no doubt. I dont want to compare its specifications with the competitors but the main USP of Samsung is their service and here they are miles ahead of Chinese counterparts. So the extra we pay for the brand actually goes for maintaining the service network and Chinese brands least care about it. I am happy paying the hefty amount for this phone because I know the brand is most reliable and as long as I own the phone, its performance and service is guaranteed.",Sunita R.,4 March 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Batter than 5T. Don't go for paid reviews of 5t over Internet.,"Brand is always Brand. There is no comparison between 5t and A8+. If you really want a durable premium phone go for A8+ instead 5t. I used both and what I feel 5t playing a big game to hit its 5t. They published only positive things about 5t everywhere on internet. I was surprised when I saw comparison of both the phone on YouTube channel technical guruji and one more channel I don't remember both are clearing saying 5t is good while in their other videos they never take favour of a specific brand. It clearly shows those reviews are paid reviews.
If you are confused between both the phones go for Samsung. For good service , durable phone, premium and trusted brand . Only higher processor and little better camera does not mean Samsung has bad quality of camera or processor.",Vikas Tiwari,24 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

No value for money,One of the worst phone i have used.. most of the time it would not charge keep on saying moisture detected in charger or wire.. this is only after 3 days of purchase.. further it says water resistant.. but the screen would start misbehaving only after a little sweat or a drop of water.. camera quality ok .. not too good.. all in all you will find a better phone at much lower cost from other brands... didnot expected this from samsung..,Shree Kant,9 June 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

"A nice ""SAMSUNG"" Phone with many qualities but some CONS too!","Being its MASSIVE user since several MONTHS, I would like to share my experiences with this phone over time:-
1) Design- GREAT, but you would need a CASE and a Tempered GLASS over as the back can get cracked on dropping the phone easily.
2) Sound- ABOVE Average, easily hearable outdoors......and also with the new update, it has dolby support for microphones use which is quite good.
3) Display- Great with nice viewing angles....easily visible outdoors so no complaints.
4) Performance- Day to day general performance is good. NOT for HEAVY GAMERS of PUBG type games. Medium graphics games will run fine though. Samsung UI might be a reason for it
5) RAM- 6gb enough for day to day usage...ram management is good but the 6gb ram is DDR3 not DDR4.....I mean SERIOUSLY??? And ya it does sometimes (rare times) lags. Heavy samsung UI might be a reason for it
6) Storage- 64gb with expandable memory card slot.....what else do you need?
7) CAMERA- Rear camera is with whom I am FULLY SATISFIED. No complaints. Front camera is great also but low-light front camera shots are above average. Videos also come out above average from both.
8) Battery- good for average user. Average for heavy users. But since it has got power saving modes which are good.....so no issues with battery life
9) Software- Feature rich with lesser bloatware as compared to previous samsung phones. So no complaints with that.
10) Security- FP sensor has improved with updates......face recognition NOT RELIABLE.
Other PROS include Dual 4G Volte, Notification light, all sensors present including gyroscope , Always ON display, seperate sim slots and micro SD card slot, IP68 rating, Bixby Vision, Samsung pay......etc.etc.
Here are some CONS though to look out for:-
1) No 5GHZ wifi band support which is sad.
2) EIS for videos is not that good
3) No slow motion video recording option
4) Speaker quality on max. volume could have been improved. Or they should have given dual speakers like C9 Pro..!
5) Gaming performance MUST be improvedüò°
6) Better battery optimisation should be done
7) Minor system UI lags must be resolved with an OTA update
8) Front camera low light quality and both cam's video quality must be improved.
9) No 4k recording at this price
10) Bixby voice could have been a plus
11) No dual LED for rear cam. Only single LED flash.
Overall a nice phone which should be improved with updates more!!üòä",Madhu Bhandari,26 July 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Five Stars,Extraordinary product better than any other china phones highly worth of money.,vijay,30 January 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Front Dual cam is simply superb but the rear cam is not good enough. don't have portrait mode in Rear cam,"I bought this mobile a month ago and now it starts lagging a bit in its performance. Since the back panel is made of Glass, the Back case provided by Samsung is not worthy enough to protect.. I just dropped 3 feet above from the table and my back panel broke even though i had the back case provided within the samsung box. So i suggest to buy a hard case for rough user.
Camera Quality. Front Dual cam is simply superb but the rear cam is not good enough. don't have portrait mode in Rear cam.

Camera Result is Good ,design ,Full HD Screen, & fingerprint sensor is fast Samsung best mobile",parth chauhan,1 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Good SmartPhone with Premium Display!! I just Love it!!,"Pros:
Excellent Display!
Screen Quality/Resolution is too Good!
Premium and Beautiful Looking Mobile and Premium feel while holding it in hand!
Good Front Camera!
Battery backup is good!
Mobile is handy even with big display though bit bulky!
Secure Samsung Pay Available!
Fast Charging within 30min from Min to Max.Fast Charger do excellent job!
Cons:
Little bit slow face recognizition at day light.Mostly it takes just 2 to 3 seconds to recognize..At dim light,it won't work mostly! But That's Ok!!Not a big Issue as at least we got this feature in this price range itself that too in the Samsung Brand!!
Rear Camera is Good but can still be more better for this Price Range!
Nothing much special in Bixby but it's fun using it!!
Battery heats up to 39'c with continuous usage of YouTube for more than 20min which is quite normal !
Sometimes battery heats up to 38.5'c while charging from minimum point like from 30% to 100% even though if we do not use the mobile while charging!This is also quite normal in smartphones! But it does not heats up a lot like honor view 10 or one plus 5t where battery heating goes above 42'c if we use YouTube for 15min!
You can monitor the battery heating by installing CPU-Z app!
Little Bit Heavy which you will get used to it while using!
Conclusion: Overall if any1 want to have a branded phone in this price range with premium display, you can go for this phone like me!! Even though if you get one plus 5t or honor view 10 with more features in this price range, Samsung Brand is Always Higher than that..And It has best service centres all over India!! And you don't get into any problem with the branded phones mostly!!
And Samsung phones Exchange Price Value is also high compared to other chinese brands ,if in case after few years if you want to exchange a mobile and buy other!!
JUST GO FOR IT!! U WILL LOVE THIS PHONE!! ""Especially Black Color Samsung Galaxy A8+""
And never buy chinese brand mobiles if u r going to buy a phone above 30k!",Chaitanya,11 February 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

I brought this mobile for 31490 in great Indian sale.
Very quick fingerprint sensor. And dust and waterproof IP68.

Best mobile for samsung lover.",Sanyogita kalwar,27 January 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Pretty decent for an average customer. Lags while playing heavy games like pubg on max settings.,"Posting this review after 3 months of heavy usage.
Pros:
1. Magnificiet battery life. Goes from 0-100% in about 1.5 hours through fast charging.
2. Large, bright, colourful screen.
3. Ram management is very good(6 gbs of ram).
4. Sound quality is pretty decent, on a scale of 0-10, would give a 9.
5. Dual front camera is very good, but hey who takes selfie all day in the time of dslrs?
6. Fingerprint scanner and face recognition is good and flawless, though it lacks an iris scanner.
7. Looks very decent with that glass back.
Cons:
1. Can not play heavy games like pubg in max graphics, but runs smoothly on lower selections of graphics.
2. The processor for the money I paid is pretty old. Add a few thousand extra bucks and get a One plus 6 instead.
3. Back camera: 16 megapixles performs decent, but lacks a bit in the generation of dual cameras.
Conclusion: If you aren't a heavy user and want decent performance in every field and also the Samsung user interface in this price range, go for it. Though would suggest the huawei honor 10 or the view 10 if you don't want the samsung UI. Both are of the same price.
And if you're looking for top notch experience, adding a few thousand bucks and getting the 0ne plus 6, won't do any harm.

Good value for money.,"Gorgeous phone. For the price point you get a great value of money.
Pros
1) Big screen at 6 inch makes reading and watch videos a breeze.
2) Good responsive phone with 64 GB ROM and 6 GB RAM.
3) The screen is almost edge to edge.
4) The Camera is good but not as great as that of Samsung S8 or an iphone.
5) Finger print scanner, for those who do not mind using it.
6) Blue light filter good for reading in the night.
7) WiFi and Bluetooth work in tandem. So if you are streaming sound from phone via WiFi into Bluetooth speaker it will work seamless.
Neutral Observations
1) A single speaker on the RHS. Would have been good if they had given dual speakers.
2) USB C charging so most of us who have micro usb chargers for them we will have to carry another cable.
Cons
1) Heavy. If you are watching movies in potrait or landscape mode then after a few minutes the hands tend to tire. Dont try to use this phone between index finger and thumb. Make it rest on your bottom palm with your 4 fingers curling on the top.
2) Battery not replaceable
3) No IR blaster, at this price it should be provided.",Amardeep,10 February 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Fabulous,"My galaxy A8+ works fine. Samsung has really worked on giving so many cool features like secure folder, wide selfie, good UI, extremely good RAM management, app customizations and many more... some of the best things about A8+ are:
*Battery lasts really long...will easily last entire day
*fast charger works really well...takes an hour and half to charge fully
*Display....this is the best thing about this phone. It is amazing...no phone in this range can beat this.....U will fall in love with the display.
*This phone is the most good looking phone...period. You will not want to keep it down from your hand.
* Really good for daily use...cool features...amazing UI....
* No lags...no heating
* Front camera is the best in class....if you are a selfie lover...u will love this phone...there is no match for the front camera....
* Sound output is fantastic. It is not like other samsung phones....it has really good loud speaker and sound clearity.
* Build quality is very good.
The only bad thing:
Rear camera needs upgrade....it will surely disappoint you....even budget phone like galaxy j7 does a far better job than this...I hope Samsung gives update for camera.
It takes good and sharp images in day light....but in artificial and low light...it fails like anything....it just doesn't lock the focus in low light.
Day light images are good.",Harsh S,20 March 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Best mobile in 2018 - A8 Plus,"This is my first SAMSUNG mobile. I am using since last one month. here is my views:
1. Super build quality with both side glass and solid metal frame.
2. Perfect size(aspect ratio), very comfortable to hold in hand.
3. sAMOLED Infinity display is looks brilliant, rich in color, its unique compare to others.
4. No lag, no any other issue with this mobile till date.
5. Battery life long lasting, I can go with more then day with single charge.
6. No heating issue, while charging, surfing internet, watching video, playing game, etc...
7. I also like fast charging function.
8. Samsung app also pleased me like, Samsung Health, Samsung members, Samsung Pay and other apps etc...
9. So many customization features available to set mobile as per my need, Multicolored notification LED, Always on display, Fonts, NFC, Smart view
to share screen.
10. Sound quality is clear & loud. While call or listening music.
11. Camera result is fine. I liked features of front dual camera. Perfect for Bokeh effect, I can also adjust amount of effect. Main camera result is also
super. Color/Clearity/Detailed photos can be taken.
12. Dedicated memory card slot, no storage issue at all with its inbuilt 64 gb + memory card.
13. Finger print working fast, Face recognition also works fine, i liked this features, but not as much fast as finger print sensor.
14. I have applied back case provided with mobile to prevent damage due to fall/slip, because back side is also furnished with glass.
I am very happy to have A8 Plus. Its working fine for me.",Mehul,25 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

It's a Winner Samsung - Great Looking Phone with Amazing Features!,"Using it for the last 4 days & I am absolutely in LOVE with this phone. The infinity display makes it look stunning with the super amoled screen. The 3500mah battery lasts full day even with a lot of multitasking. Huge 64gb device storage plus great to see separate mmc and 2 sim slots. The 6 GB RAM makes use of apps really smooth. This phone also supports Samsung Pay which makes it very convenient to virtually carry & use my credit/debit cards. It's also water resistant ! All round features at a very amazing price. Super Satisfied!
And thank u Amazon for a Super Quick Delivery.
Update: Tip on face recognition. While setting it up do it under low light. This makes recognition really fast and accurate. The dual selfie camera is cool. Crisp clear pictures.",SKM,25 January 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Watch out!,"I bought this phone almost a week after launch with MRP ~ 33k. On the prime day sale, price has been mentioned at ~ 42k and slashed to ~ 30k. How does the original price surge so sharply? Especially considering how any phone depreciates in its value as time goes by.
People better start understanding these sale baits, otherwise there will be people living at your expense.
To speak about the phone, been 4 months and for me it fits the purpose. Camera, I would say is the selling point for this phone. Pictures really come out good in good lighting. Besides, low light pictures have been mediocre. Sound as always not Samsung's cup of tea and was a let down. I haven't really explored the possibility of rooting and further improvisations. Believe it should give us more options/leverage.",Amazon Customer,16 July 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Instead buy Zenfone 5z!,"Samsung A8+ is a good phone but at this price other competitors are providing snapdragon 845 like the newly launched asus zenfone 5z or the flagship killer Oneplus and what samsung is providing you is just providing exynos 7885 and spending 30000 just for an infinity display that still has thick bezel.

In this price segment, your obviously considering the OnePlus5T. Go for A8+ is my opinion. OP5T doesn't have Samsung Pay (it's ultra convenient, trust me) and I click more using my front camera than my rear camera anyway. With that said, the rear camera is really great too, it is by no means, a compromise.

The notification bar is hard to reach. The sound port can get accidentally covered. Glass back so lots of smudges and you have to be careful. I would recommend using a case.

A phone with compromised camera and processor.. An insult to its pricing,"Many has praised this phone enough. Now it's time to criticise when you spend 31.5k on a phone instead of typical 20 to 25k I usually spend. I will mostly talk about day to day problems which matters most to everyone. I was in dire need of a decent camera phone for my upcoming travel then. The 6 gb ram and dual selfie made me buy this phone, I also simply expected that rear camera, my primary need, would be without problems. Well this is where Samsung screwed up which still bothers me until today.
CAMERA:
The front and rear camera both do not have Optical Image Sensor and therefore all those people who do not have very stable hand will suffer from blur photographs and even more blur in low light. Not to me but blur selfies can be even more insulting with a group and a big let down for selfie enthusiasts. In my recent travel, even after due care while taking pictures, 10% of the total pictures from my bulk are still blur and I have yet to delete them from the gallery. Writing this after 2 months seriously this phone's rear camera sucks big time. Many photos taken are blur especially when taken by someone like my mother. Lack of OIS reflects in your daily photography headache. Shame for its price, this phone does not deserve the value they took from the customers. This is some kind of loot in the name of big screen and glass body. After contacting Samsung, they are replying with their stupid templates as if there is no human to understand and accept the problem.
PROCESSOR:
Yon know Samsung UI. It is a blessing and headache at the same time. Thanks to Android hunger for RAM and Samsung contribution in further exploitation of the same. There are lot of Samsung apps which are not useful for everyone which needs RAM and processor usage in the background. Samsung do not care and they still stuff the crap up the phone's throat. As you know Samsung believe in giving quantity instead of quality just like they launch a new phone model every quarter. They could not control ram usage so they gave 6 gb ram. Thank god! I would never buy a Samsung's true smartphone with 4 gb ram. But even after giving 6 gb ram Samsung still screwed up here as well by using some low end processor found in cheaper phones. The 2 year old s7 still leads in benchmarking against this phone. Do check processor specs before you buy this phone. That is why the not so fast processor chipset heats up the phone when I use GPS and stream music via bluetooth at the same time in the car. It is simply because the low power processor used is unable to give enough power to modern OS resulting in overload on the whole chipset and therefore more heat to cope up. Another shame it is!
SPEAKER:
I need to watch video sometimes for learnings and entertainment but the speaker volume is not enough for outdoors. For indoor it is ok but not acceptable for this class of phone. No dolby and loudness enhancement to fix this. Another backward hardware it is.
MISC:
There is no wireless charging. Screen glass & back is not much scratch resistant, I already see micro scratches caused from the in-box provided case. World is moving to shock proof screens and I expect at least a better gorilla glass here if they have gone for glass body. Samsung did not share the type of glass used in their spec sheet. Its also a fingerprint magnet.
My mistake is I did not do enough research on specs of camera and processor and bought it too soon on launch. At this price point such blunders are not acceptable, but Samsung is Samsung.
Three less stars for three big problems mentioned above.
I would not criticize about big form factor, low screen resolution or phone still on nougat because I already knew that. If anyone is a Samsung fan and need a good budget phone today then they should go for Samsung S7 which is still a very good camera phone with surprisingly better processor & screen than this phone at much cheaper price.",Abhishek Malik,11 March 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars

The processor is doing a great job in terms of performance and 6 GB RAM is sufficient. These where the things I liked. When it comes to camera, I'm disappointed with rear camera performance. It works fine in outdoor sunlight, but in artificial light and low light, it struggles. Front facing camera is good, but not excellent. It doesn't provide a wide angle except with software support.

A poor man‚Äôs S8+,"This marvel by Samsung is a revolution in the mid ranger category for smartphones. So let me focus on the order of unboxing to the device itself.
1. Out of the box this device has a stunning FHD+ sAMOLED display and a gorgeous but not so fingerprint and sumdge proof back panel. The good thing is the back cover which is inclusive.
2. The device runs on Android nougat out of the box is a bit disappointing but as per Samsung it‚Äôs next in line only after the S8 and note 8 to get the Oreo updates.
3. The UI and the performance is fluidic with the on board 6 gb of ram. This device has a great single core and multicore performance which is the best in this category.
4. Samsung Pay is a great thing.
5. The cameras are great for the category.
6. The fingerprint sensor is nicely placed. The facial recognition is two factor and not smooth.
7. The weight is a bit on the higher side but all flagships are anyway.
8. The size of the device makes you use two hands but the display does say 6.0 inches which you already know while buying. So it‚Äôs bogus to complain over the size. It‚Äôs like asking for note 8 in the size of iPhone SE.

‚òÜNo heating issue
‚òÜNice display[infinity]
‚òÜSamsung Pay with Knox

Cons- Glass body so requires more care but gives a premium fell
‚òÜ not have dual back camera but if someone investing 32k on mobile can easily afford a DSLR. But have a dual selfie camera as u cant click a selfie with dslr.

Awsum,"Ordered this phone on the very first day was eagerly waiting for its release.
Thanks to Amazon for delivering it on time..
From the very beginning i was sure that i will only buy Samsung brand despite tough competition from One plus 5T and Honor 10 x i choosed Samsung A8+ coz of the brand name..
Battery life is normal with fast charging support with usb type c port which fully charges the phone in hour and a half.
Front camera is superb with bokeh effect now you can blur ur background using live focus mode and with added AR stickers you can bring life to your features..
Performance is awsum despite not having snapdragon processor supported by 6GB of ram i faced no problem at all playing high end games like GTA etc..
Stunning looks with infinity display back side with glass and sides protected with metal body and resembles quite similar with Samsung Note 8.
Advise you to buy black colour looks stunning if u r a boy and girls can go with golden depending on ur choice..
Highly reccomended still not getting oreo update bur samsung will uodate it soon..
Thanks..",Mohsin,24 March 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

The Galaxy A8+ is good ‚Äî just not as good as other devices in this category.,"We'll get to how Samsung is responding to Xiaomi's threat in a few weeks' time, but for now, it's time to take a look at how the company is gunning after OnePlus with its latest device in the Galaxy A series. This is the Galaxy A8+ 2018.
I (Kshitiz) am writing this review after using the Galaxy A8+ as my daily driver for over two weeks in Hyderabad, India. The unit was provided by Samsung India, and was connected to Airtel's 4G network for the duration of the review. The device picked up a single software update with stability fixes and the January 1, 2018 security patch

With the Galaxy A8+, Samsung is bringing over its Infinity Display design aesthetic over to the mid-range segment. Like the S8 series and the Note 8, the A8+ has an 18.5:9 panel with narrow bezels, but there are a few differences. First up, the display itself is FHD+ and not QHD+ like the flagships, and the panel isn't curved. So the overall effect isn't quite as breathtaking as what you'd get on the Note 8.
The A8+ has provision for two SIM cards and a microSD slot, but instead of a single SIM card tray, you get two. The slot for the first SIM card is located to the right of the device, and the tray for the secondary SIM card and the microSD slot is at the top of the phone. The overall design certainly won't turn any heads (let's call it Infinity Display Lite), but the A8+ still comes across as a premium device.
Galaxy A8+ Software:
For a device releasing in January 2018, it's inexcusable that the A8+ comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box. It's possible that Samsung is saving the Oreo build for the Galaxy S9, which is set to make its debut on February 26. As a result, what we have with the A8+ is a software experience that should be immediately familiar if you've used a Samsung device in 2017.
And considering just how long it takes Samsung to roll out an update, it's entirely likely the Oreo update won't be available for the device until the next quarter (if not longer). Samsung has to contend with hundreds of regional variants and carrier models when it comes to platform updates, so it's understandable that they take time.
But there's nothing stopping the company from launching a new device with the latest version of Android, particularly when you consider that the first developer build for Oreo rolled out over ten months ago.
Should you buy it ‚ùìA BIG NO‚ùå‚ùå
Aside from the fact that it runs Nougat out of the box, there's nothing particularly wrong with the Galaxy A8+. In fact, it's clear that the A8+ is the best device in the Galaxy A series thus far. However, while the South Korean manufacturer was perfecting its model for an affordable flagship, other brands haven't been idle.
The Galaxy A8+ retails for ‚Çπ32,999 ($520) in India, putting it squarely in the crosshairs of the OnePlus 5T, which costs exactly the same. The Mi Mix 2 is also on sale for the same price, so there certainly isn't a dearth of choice here.",Hari Parkash,5 May 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Check out the low light pic I've taken in a8+ at 12 in the mid night with out any light. And the selfies are great as it was a selfie centric phone.

Awesome Selfie cameras Live focus is terrific for selfie portraits - Average rear main camera which goes from average to worst in low light conditions. At this price range we expect more quality from Samsung.
Bulid quality is top notch - feels sturdy
Looks are very much premiuim.
Screen is just awesome - watching videos in full view is altogether a different experience.
Speakers are loud and clear and their placement on the sides is a worthy experiment works well in practicality.
IP68 Certification means its protected from water and dust ! Bang on
Still waiting for Oreo - but don't know how it affects the average user.
I am not a gamer so can't comment on that , but working with multiple apps even in split screen is nothing for this powerful processor .

Awesome phone. 5 stars.,"This phone is perfect. I chose this over 5t due to its build quality and looks. Also I am using 2 sim cards and one memory card simultaneously. Again it is water and dust proof. On paper 5t has more power. However you can't feel any difference in day to day life while using this phone.
FYI I have been using iPhones since last 4 years. They all have max 1GB to 2 GB RAM and their processors are clocked at less than 1.5 Hz. I didn't face any problems with the iPhones.
This Samsung phone is super smooth. Selfies are awesome. Battery back up is very good. Charging time is max 1:45 hrs.
Coming to 4K and slow motion video shooting :
This phone can't shoot 4K and slow motion videos. Tell me one thing do we really need 4K and slow motion videos in our day to day life. You can't even differentiate between 720p and 1080p videos while watching them on a 13 inch laptop.

4. IP68 - waterproof
5. Type C USB fast charger
6. Comes with a transparent back case
7. Premium look and feel
8. It accepts 2 sims and additional memory card - a feat which even s8 cannot match with! Really! S8 can only take in either 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims - if you don't believe go and check specs of s8 ! I have both a8+ and s8 hence can vouch !

1. It doesn't say anywhere in the spec that it has Gorilla Glass 5, but a google search states it does
2. The handsfree comes with a fixed sized in-the-ear bud. Samsung could have thrown in few smaller sizes as well.
3. Branded cases on amazon are far and few. No otterbox, no spigen etc
UPDATE:
I was so happy with this model that I purchased another one for my wife!
Con:
- comes in only 2 colors; gold and black
- the new S9 comes in an envious choice of colors",Blur,5 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
It is very amazing phone and Feels like a premium,"It is very amazing phone and Feels like a premium.64gb inbuilt storage plus 6gb ram plus waterproof that's a great. It is samsung product,üëç",Mandar,28 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
ONE PLUS 5T KILLER FROM SAMSUNG (SAMSUNG GALAXY A8+),"Very good handset from Samsung at this price point
We can say it is the One Plus 5T 6 GB ram variant killer due its few extra features such as
1: Samsung Pay
2: IP68 dust and water resistance
3: Expandable Memory up to 256 GB (Without Hybrid Sim Slot)
4: Bixby - which is unique to Samsung Flagship Headsets
5: Dual front Camera with live Focus
6: Good camera for low Light Shots
7: Easy Grip in hand irrespective of big screen size
8: 18.5:9 Aspect ratio and Infinity Display which is Also offered by One Plus 5T
9: Powerful 3500mah battery with Fast charging Support as compared to 3300 mah battery with Dash Charging in the One Plus 5T
10: Value for Money Along with SAMSUNG Brand name and SERVICE
But it has some negatives too
1: Lack of dual cameras at the rear as in the case of One Plus 5T which has Dual Rear Cameras
2: Glass back make it look PREMIUM but attracts fingerprints quite offen
3: Faster face unlock but not as fast as One Plus 5T",Mamta Singh,24 January 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

A premium phone with all premium qualities near to flagship phones.,"Very nice smart phone almost similar to galaxy S8 except quad display. Otherwise, for general use and without finer assessment, it's really similar to Samsung flagship phones though in premium category. I am simultaneously using Oneplus 5T also but very happy to have this premium category phone of Samsung. Lots of essential software being provided by Samsung. It's a great phone unless you want to show that you are using highest priced flagship phone of any company with lots of irrelevant high tech provisions of no use to general use to general people of less tech knowledge.",Avijit Roy,12 March 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Very amazing phone by samsung,"Very amazing phone by samsung. Battery lasts long. Biggest enemy of one plus 5t. One hand mode, multi window these are some awesome features by samsung. We can use two sims at a time that's the biggest pros for today's smartphones. Gaming is very smooth with 6gb of ram. Lot of internal memory for normal user. Front camera awesome. Bixby voice assistant will be in this phone in next updates. Fingerprint and facelocks are so fast and impressive. Thanks to amazon prime to deliver it in 1 day. I was using two phones one iphone nd one android . This phone is enough for the work of that two.
Really happy after having this phone.

Great phone; Value for money best of Samsung in 30k price range,"First of all; don't compare it with one plus MI or Vivo OPPO; if you do Yolo should be reviewing it and comparing one year down the line. Durability and service quality is what defines Samsung. At 31k you are getting a front dual camera water resistance and 6gb Ram. I just love the features and performance.
Chinese brands may give you better looks, better price and configuration; but when it comes to actual performance you will realize that Samsung is still the boss ! Though this device had an mrp of 41k Samsung had to bring it down due to Chinese phones competing. This is the first device of Samsung that's not over priced.
Camera givesa stunning performance and I haven't seen any lags so far. Face recognition isn't iris based, but does a decent job. I just wish Samsung had a primary dual camera for this device as well. Nevertheless, the existing camera does a pretty good job.
Front dual camera is just as good as my DSLR.",Pradeep S.,24 January 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE U BUY.,"The screen is very sensitive.I bought this phone immediately after Amazon released online.Without knowing the additional factors I bought this phone.I tried to fix a screen guard.but It was not available in the market even amazon online.Now the Pathetic situation is that phone screen was broken.Contacted Samsung CC and they intended to charge Rs13000/-.So be cautious whenever you buy a phone online, make sure to secure the mobile first.",Ramana Prasad,17 April 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

2. Mic seems to be not that catchy while u r moving

Just Go and Buy this Beautiful Beast.,"Awesome phone.. I was confused between oneplus 5t and samsung A8+. But I finally chose Samsung A8+. First of all Best Premium looking (oneplus 5t doesn't look good when you hold both phone in hands). A8+ has true flagship style and premium build. Secondly, Awesome SuperAmoled Display. No one can beat Samsung in their S.Amoled display.
This phone is for those people who can't afford Galaxy Note-8. It also looks same like Note-8 in more than half price. Touch,UI and Display combination is Awesome. Dual 4G sim+ dedicated Memory slot is very cool move and ofcourse 64gb Internal and 6 Gb f RAM are awesome features.
Both Cameras Perform well. But I was expecting Rear camera to be little more Powerful but It works Well. Only suffers in too much dark. Otherwise Superb in Daylight, Indoor and low light shots. Front is Awesome too. Specially I like to capture selfies with Bokeh mode which is also adjustable after photo is clicked. I wish the Same Potrait Mode or Live Focus Mode in rear camera too which would make it Better. Performance isn't an issue with 6gb RAM and powerfull Processor. However slight lags sometimes in Heavy games. Otherwise playing games is smooth.
These all can be improved more by minor updates and here Samsung is Good in Improving things..
It offers More Features like Samsung Members, Samsung Pay, Bixby, Smart Camera which Can do lots of things. (experience it when you grab your A8+), Water & Dust resistant is Cherry on the Cake. Different Camera modes are good too. This phone offers everthing and all modes that samsung falgships offer. Fast charging is nice feature.
In short Don't Go for any Chinese Brands as they doesn't offer quality product and services like Samsung. Samsung is Most trusted Brand and Ahead in Sales not only in India but also in the World. This is made in India product too. So Kick all the bad rumours about Samsung and Just Blindly go for it.
HD video watching is Full of amusement Thanks to S.Amoled Display.
Grab your own and Experience it.
Now I am feeling little disappointed as Samsung has slashed the price. Now it is 4000 Rs cheap. So I feel like I have made Mistake by buying it in 33000 only a month ago.",Kathan,2 February 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

The pros are 1) Excellent display. Really stands out 2) Great build quality ...,"The pros are
1) Excellent display. Really stands out
2) Great build quality which gives the phone a premium feel.
3) Excellent sound quality
4) Capable camera hardware
5) Really useful software features from Samsung which includes direct call (auto call the contact when you get the phone near your ears) , live adjust for apps to fit 18:9 display, lot of battery power optimization options.
6) Produces excellent close up shots like the one attached
Areas of improvement
1) Live focus is a hit and miss scenario. You can take really good photos if you act like a pro or in ideal conditions. Definitely needs software update in terms of stabilization and processing. If you dont keep your hands steady, you and up with blurred photos even in good lighting.
2) Placement of figure print scanner is still not ideal. It should have been a bit more lower. This is still manageable as you get used to.
3) Improvements are required for facial recognition as well.
4) Missing android Oreo and we are in 2018.
5) Pictures taken are very bad and really disappoinitng to the extent that I feel even a budget phone could take better pictures. Hoping an update will improve this as the hardware is capable. The phone gives an oil painting effect to all photos which is very annoying and there is no raw image format support. Will give a 5 star if this is improved and I expect drastic improvements because the camera hardware is capable and in fact is the same as that is available on Oneplus5T. Only hope is that I have already received 2 updates till date. So I guess Samsung is working on overall improvements.
CONS:
1) Experiencing battery drainage. Lost 40% of charge without any use from previous night to next day morning.
Things to note
1) People should be ready to move away from single handed operations specially those who are migrating from 5.5"" form factor phones. The phone is handy but definitely not for single handed operations in most scenarios",Rahul P.,24 January 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
