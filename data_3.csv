Cell was delivered on time but after installing the sim when started the cell found out the bottom touch sensor srcreen( Back ,home and multitasking touch area ) not operational .

0.000 marks for Amazon Transportation Services,"Display is best available in this planet right now. Camera may be too. Dolby Atmos works like a charm. Headphones are of top notch. Go for it if you have an iphone budget for an android.
Amazon Transportation Services i guess is the worst in this planet. . First when i called he mentioned that my office is closed due to Saturday. But u fortunately he forgot that it’s a bank and it remains open. He was caught in his play. Then The delivery guy postponed my delivery only because he needs to take a U turn on the highway to reach my office. Then he stopped picking my calls. Then one of my femal colleague called and he came for delivery. Sad state of affairs at Amazon Transportation Services. Also the delivery agent number couldn’t be reached because they are equipped with JIO phones. That adds to the agony.
During last order too the delivery guy canceled my order saying my address isn’t traceable. Sadly my address itself is a landmark in that area.
I escalated to Amazon and they did it again.
If possible avoid Amazon. They create depression instead of happiness.",Dibyajyoti Gogoi,4 November 2018,Verified Purchase
Great over all package,Great overall package. Loved the burgundy red colour. Nice edge display. Good sound quality. Camera is decent but pictures are oversaturated. Low light images are good.

The S9+ SM-G965F/DS Burgandy,"It’s a great futuristic phone with great camera in the segment available yet.
The burgandy edition (Not pure red) is an international version SM-G965F/DS
and a Non American model. (Difference is only- No FM, No Snapdragon chip and No Adreno GPU) but Samsung Exynos 9 chip and Mali GPU.
Package includes a transparent sturdy back cover and Burgandy AKG earphone.
Security includes Pin, Fingerprint, Pattern Lock, Face detection, Iris scan.
Also wireless fast charging is a plus.
Battery is 3500 mah but great if used with customized phone settings.",mukul326,26 November 2018,Verified Purchase

From having the best possible display to being water resistant, AKG powred sound grills, stunning camera with a smooth ois, expandable srorage also not forget the mighty headphone jack. However, the only department it lags in is the Battery. Gives me a 5-6 hour on screen time with mid/heavy usage.

Great if the price is right,"Phone is excellent if bought in offer which reduces its price to near 38k...which is great but if bought for the full price of 61k it is absolutely no value for money as u can get a note 9 for 61k officially without any exchange and the note 9 is a far superior phone in terms of battery life low light camera and internal storage
Coming to the pros and cons
Pros
Good screen excellent colour reproduction punchy amoled
Sound quality is awesome both through headphones and dual speaker
Good stylish build quality
Compact easy to handle
Excellent camera on par with most if not all flagships
Great value for money if bought in the price range of 38k to 40k
Anything above that is not acceptable
Cons
For the price of 61k a much better phone the note 9 is available in the market which diminishes this phones value
Battery life is at best mediocre even if using power saver and hd+resolution...its ok for basic tasks like calling messaging WhatsApp etc
But push something heavy and the battery begins to drain faster
64gb for 61k especially when other competitors and Samsung itself is offering 128gb internal storage on its base variant note 9 is just unacceptable as in this day n age memory tends to get filled up pretty fast and those who use dual sim cant rely on sd card since its hybrid
Slow android updates no bixby 2.0 till now
again this phone is great if its price was around 40k but 61k is just not right especially since the competition is giving much more
Samsung should really reduce the price officially since not everyone has a phone to exchange and hence cannot avail the offers
Thank you",Ishaan f,18 November 2018,Verified Purchase
Biggest mistake buying this phone in greed of sale.,"Don't buy this phone if you don't want yourself stuck with charger ND phone permanently. Doesn't matter how much apps you have in your phone, battery will drain rapidly. Just google ""s9+ battery problem"" and save yourself from the hassles of life. And low light is pathetic in front camera,",puneet,5 November 2018,Verified Purchase
A great deal,"Bought this during sale period at an amazing exchange value and discounts. I was eying this mobile for a long time and so happy to finally have this.
I am more into music, movies and photography, so my top reasons to buy-
1. Best display quality
2. Superior build quality, specially the edge screen
3. Amazing camera, specially in low light conditions
4. Slow motion shooting mode
5. I guess this has the best speakers among all smartphones
6. Earphones provided in the box were surprisingly great",Mr Bajpai,9 November 2018,Verified Purchase

Superb and a Must Buy if on Discount,"The phone is Simply Superb . The best camera in the market (if used properly). The battery is good, lasts for a Day of heavy use. So it does the job well.

an upgrade from OnePlus 5T, not a major one,

Got exchanged LG G3, which was worth for nothing, exchanged for 11k,
Battery is an issue, no fast charging as supported by Dash charger, and lil bit bulky, no tempered / screen guard best available, flip cover makes it heavy,

will update after rigororus use..",Shraddha,26 October 2018,Verified Purchase

Great device but overall poor support from Samsung and Amazon,"I recently purchased the S9 Plus(Coral Blue) and it wasn't even in my wishlist before few days,I was willing to buy the One Plus 6T but felt disappointed with the overall device,so decided to go for S9 Plus and got it for 41K after all offers and exchanges
Display : One of the best hands down,I have compared it with One Plus 6T and Iphone XS Max and it is better than both,plus those curves make the device look just so beautiful no complaints here.
Built : Same as the S8 Plus,but still overall it looks like a really expensive device and yes it it,so justifies the price,has glass at the back so happy with the built, Coral Blue looks beautiful.
Battery : This is the only area I am disappointed,just 3500 mah battery capacity and it drains pretty quickly on games like PUBG,Asphalt 9, and earlier I was using Dash Charge so I am addicted to those high speeds,but S9 Plus just supports QC 2.0 so charging feels really slow and it takes about just over 1 hr 40 mins to completely charge the phone from 0 to 100%,Samsung should have atleast included QC 3.0.
Cameras : Lots and Lots of modes are provided to enhance the camera performance like portrait ,pro mode, selfie focus, food and many more,plus they have added AR Emoji that is replica of Animoji from Apple,but it is really bad,all people look like same character,they should improve it,the cameras have another feature,on taking any potrait shot on rear camera you can adjust the background blur even after taking the picture and you can also change the same picture to wide angle shot.
Low light performance is great and the variable aperture acts as a useful feature,not just a gimmick,Super Slow Mo is cool to have but limited to just few seconds, video recording is Ok but colors little over saturated(I personally like it this way)
Performance : Indian variant comes with Xynos 9810 SOC and Mali Processor,as such Mali is not considered good for gaming but ,For gaming I have played PUBG and Asphalt 9 and both work super smooth,I play PUBG on HDR(Ultra) and yes it works fine, but the phone tends to heat after few minutes of game play, I guess it is normal for any phone to heat with those high graphic settings, and in case of applications it is quick to open almost all applications and haven't faced any lags till now.
UI/Software : Yes it is not as stock or Oxygen but still after using Oxygen OS before, I am even happy using Samsung Experience 9.0, it has few flaunting features like the Edge Lighting,Dolby Atmos Audio,great gestures,and much more
Audio : Having stereo speakers,it is on of the best sound I have heard on any Smartphone,and the sound output through the headphone jack is amazing and on enabling Dolby Atmos you'll really find a good difference in sound(I use it with Poweramp and Amazon Music).
Security : You can unlock your phone in 4 ways :
Iris : Slow but accurate
Face : Really Fast
Fingerprint at the back : Again it's super fast
Face+Iris : Slow but really secure
Android Updates : When I got the phone it was on October Security Patch Update so means Samsung is providing updates,but still no sign of Android Pie,maybe it'll come near by the launch of Galaxy S10.
Overall : I got this phone at 41K and I am really happy with overall device,leaving aside the battery everything is premium and that display alone is a reason to show off with the edge lighting on for Notifications,Camera's are excellent,Audio is amazing and Samsung UI has tons of small features that any one would love to have.
Note : I gave the device 5 stars earlier but After using it for 20 days I have got scratches on the display,I don't know how,gorilla glass 5 on device really looks fragile,using it with proper flip cover and all,now Samsung and Amazon are not helping and putting the blame on one another,so I am disappointed with my purchase :(",Kumar Vishwas,6 November 2018,Verified Purchase
