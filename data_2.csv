Worst phone,"1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.
2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.
3. Camera quality is very poor.
4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.
5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.
6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.

OnePlus 6T,I bought onepluse6t product on 1st Nov and today my phone cameras are not working . Please consider my experience with OnePlus before you buying this product.,Amazon Customer,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing beast within the chasis of a beauty !!,"First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.
Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.
Battery life is best among all one plus phones.
Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.

Perfect in all aspects!,"Well, as they claim, it is a flagship killer.
Superfast charging, barely takes and hour to charge almost full. Speaker is loud enough.
Worth the money. OnePlus also proved their worth over the years by providing timely android updates for a long time. So this phone can be used for atleast 5 years without any worries.
Totally loved it.

ONEPLUS COPIES EVERYTHING FROM VIVO V11 PHONE I THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO COPY BATTERY FROM MI AND ASUS. WASTED 38000. IF U HAVE TO WASTE 38000 THEN GO FOR IT.

"Exuberance, an adjective for 6T.","Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is absence 3.5 mm headphone jack.

Battery problem and disappointing customer support.,"OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?
My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.
It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.
I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.",Mani,13 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Dead on arrival,"I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on. It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that. No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off. Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone??? Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one. Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release. I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.",klknow,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon just cheats their customers,"OnePlus 6t is an amazing phone but the worst is Amazon service. I had prebooked the OnePlus 6t on 26th of October and was entitled for the free earphones and 500 Amazon cash back. The worst part is they allow to buy gift card more than one and while booking it is limited toonly one unit per ID. So to order the phone I had to use another ID. Now I got to know that I'm not entitled to get the preorder promotions.
The question arises is why they allow to purchase 2 gift cards and redeem only one.",abhinav saksena,7 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Defected display phone one plus 6t dileverd by Amazon.,"There is white light line on the left side of display. Amazon send me defected item, as you see on the snap shot giving above. And Amazon says install smartckeck and take snap shot and send. They will see and not replacing my phone as they say we replace with in 10 days. Disgusting. It was my last item I purchased by Amazon.",sanjay,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Value for money. Hardware and Software are top notch.,"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.
Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.
I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.
Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!",Surya Kiran,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Worst experience ever faced with amazon.,"Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly. They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit.
Worst experience faced ever.
Don't buy anything from Amazon.

Not happy with 6T,Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause in draining the battery. Not happy with it.

Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus.",Ravi B.,6 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
6t is good but doesn't worth buying at 36k,The whole product is good but 36k is more for it,Amazon Customer,8 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
If your only need speed and battery life go for it.,It is not worth for the money. Low light camera performance still low. 25K poco does equal to 6T. In display finger print is laggy. You definitely won't like it. Good battery life.Average display. Performance is good.,Munisekaran,7 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Doesn't match the oneplus standard,Battery sucks.. 6 was much better than 6T hands down. I feel most of the reviews are paid reviews. I have been a proud owner of oneplus products but i am really disappointed in 6t. The battery won't last for a day even with minimal usage.,suraj nayak,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

Detailed review after 24 hours usage with battery statistics,"NOTE:
@ Try to buy it in ongoing sale for best price.
@ If you are normal or even heavy user, then just go for 6GB variant. Its more than enough to handle almost everything.
After using this smartphone for more than 24 hours, following are the observations,
●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●●
# Awesome Build quality.
# Great Infinity Display with Crystal Clear output ( ~86% screen to body ratio )
# Above average Camera quality.
# Insane Battery Backup.
# Flawless in Multitasking ( No Lags detected at all )
# Sufficiently Large memory.
# Lightening Fast in-display Finger print scanner.
# Even faster Face unlock.
DETAILED REVIEW -->
===============
BUILD QUALITY :--
---------------------
1. Build Quality is Great and it looks very Rigid.
2. Light Weight about 185g considering the size of phone.
3. Glass Finish looks very Premium, but is strong finger print magnet.
4. Has Corning Gorilla Glass 6.
5. Fingerprint sensor is Lightening Fast.
PROCESSOR & MEMORY :--
------------------------------------
1. Have 2.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 octa core processor with Adreno 630 Graphics Unit.
2. This Processor perfectly balance the Battery life & Performance.
3. 6GB Ram is great and handles Heavy Multitasking seamlessly.
4. Has 128GB in-built memory, which is more than sufficient.
5. Supports Android Oreo out of the box.
DISPLAY :--
------------
1. Screen is 6.42 inches Optic AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass 6.
2. Has Awesome Viewing Angles.
3. Brightness is also well balanced with the Pixel density.
4. Has good screen to Body ratio ( ~86% ).
# Has decent Pixel Density ~402 ppi which gives crystal Clear display output.
5. In display finger print scanner is the USP of this device and stands out with the amazing unlock animation.
BATTERY PERFORMANCE :--
------------------------------------
1. Charged from 45 to 100% in just 1hour with stock charger.
2. This is so far Quickest Charging Time available in any smartphone.
3. Its being over 28 hours now since the full charge, and battery has drained only 29%.
* In this meantime, I have kept the 4G ON continuously ( JIO 4G ).
4. I got screen time of 2 hours, so far. So by this equation, I shall get over 8 hours of screen time with 4G continuously ON and over 2 Days of Standby time.
*** I will update the battery performance after more detailed results.
CAMERA QUALITY :--
-------------------------
This is the section were I am Disappointed.
1. Night mode is Disaster and certainly not for the on the go users.
* A single snap in this mode takes from 5secs to 15secs, and any single movement distorts the image.
2. Photos in normal mode are much better.
3. Video recording is upto 4K 60 FPS which is good, but there's NO Slow motion.
4. Portrait mode also looks similar to previous version.
5. Front selfie camera is also not very impressive. Its Not at all worth the 38k price tag.
CONNECTIVITY :--
--------------------
So far I used JIO sim card alone and was facing issue while downloading.
1. Calling is fine.
2. Web browsing is also fine.
3. But downloading speed used to fluctuate from 10kbps to 700kbps, very frequently.
* Frequency of speed variation was way to much.
OTHER FEATURES :--
--------------------------
1. Finger Print Sensor is Lightening Fast.
2. Games like PUBG works buttery smooth even at Ultra High settings.
CONS :
------
1. Camera is Not impressive.
2. NO earphone jack.
3. Ram Consumption by System apps. is above moderate.
4. Phone is very Slippery and prone to complete Damage if falls.
5. Phone is literally finger print magnet.
VERDICT :--
------------
Considering the price and the feature, if you get it for 38K, then don't go for it. Its not worth that price.
I got this phone at 3k less and plus I got type -C earphone Free, so if you are going to get any discount, then only go for it. Else better go for something else.",Mr.Perfectionist,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Don't think again... Go for it,"Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.
Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).
Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.
Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.
I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.
Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.",Mohammad Naumaan K,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Value for money and a treat to have,"DESIGN:
If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.
Visible differences between 6 & 6T:
Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.
Technical advancement:
Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.
CAMERA:
I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.
BATTERY:
Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !
SPEAKERS:
External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.
SECURITY:
Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes.",Amazon Customer,11 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Overall phone is recommendable,Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor.

OnePlus's best phone till date! It's not just a simple upgrade from 6. Its a serious and real one.,"Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.
* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.
* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).
* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.
* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.
This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!",Ajay Aradhya,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Technically impressive and undeniable,"The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.
Cons :
Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.
One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging.",Selvakumar Selvanathan,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome phone!,"This is my first OnePlus Device and it feels amazing that how fast this phone is! I switched from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I'm glad I did....Battery life is just outstanding and I've never ever got such a powerful battery ever in my smartphone life. It actually lasts more than a day with lots of playing (I'm a Gamer) and general usage. Camera is also very good and certainly better than my previous phone. UI is clean and lightning fast. Build quality and finish is premium, sturdy and not at all fragile. The in-box Type-C to 3.5mm Adapter solves the absence of headphone jack problem. The supplied case is of premium quality and easily gives all-round protection to any angle falls. Dash charging is superb too. Android Pie out-of-the-box is cool but restricts call recording from third party apps (which is must for me), but OP did a fantastic job of putting in-built call recorder which works flawlessly in Pie as well. As of now, I don't see a single negative point for this phone. Its truly a remarkable one! Thank You OnePlus and Amazon!",Neo,12 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Beautiful Beast,"I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.
Pros :-
1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.
2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.
3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.
4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.
5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.
6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.
Cons:-
1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.
2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.
3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.
4) No dual speaker.
Conclusion:
It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it.",Utkarsh D,6 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Very bad in-display fingerprint sensor,"The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.
They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.",DT,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
phone stucking regularly,My new one plus 6t is stucking a lot. Screen getting blank every time it get stucked. It stucked 5 times in last two days. Requesting you to please replace my phone.,ANKIT BAHETI,10 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Moved from Samsung to Oneplus,"I was little worried about my moving from samsung to oneplus but when i got device - Its really Amazing. Display qwality is Excellent . I dont need sount so i didnt spend any time to its external sound qwality but when i listen earphone qwality its was too superb in my basic earphone means phone sounds is also good. Camera Performances is mindblowing when you turn on selfie camera in full mode then you ll see - it ll show you actual color contrast instead of fake beauty color like oppo /vivo/ now samsung also. True color comes with minor effects. Rear camera superb in Daylight . I think more time needed to understand full camera mode skills to take better pics. I installed pixel 3 camera port apk in my 6T - guys youll be amaze to see its effect .truely outstanding. I share this pic which i took in late light almost 01.00 AM in very low light . Here i wanna ask the oneplus developers that when this camera app works too better in 6T camera hardwrae then i think it this algorithym should be take in 6T stock camera night scape mode bcz 6T camera capable to take this brighter shots by this app then whynt from stock app ?
Overall experience is in one word :-
Right decison for change the Taste",Ashish,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Excellent sound quality
Display is above average
Battery backup is good. Charging is superfast.
Alert slider is a new thing.

Best value. Better than stock.,"I was considering pixel 3xl, but believe me this is way more better than half a pixel 3xl(may be even better than a full one ..lol). This phone is super practical and is a real companion in your day to day tasks. The gestures are beautiful. RAM is so much that I guess whole OS would fit in making everything just spontaneous. Zero lag in any thing. The draw V to start torch is super handy. Camera might not be like pixel 3xl, but for a person who takes normal amount of photos, it is more than sufficient. You won't be unhappy at all with camera.
It comes with screen protector preapplied. A very good case.
No headphones - not a big deal(u probably will buy your own at some stage)
Fingerprint sensor is like just a little bit under 1 second. But it won't make your life slow at all.
If you can afford it and want an upgrade, buy it, period",Anonymous,10 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing phone at this price point. (Not a professional just a review on personal experience),"Firstly i would like to thank oneplus for making a device like that. The best part of the phone is the performance which you expect from a snapdragon 845 chip .. obviously you are paying for that.
(Or han"" don't do the math"" i have poco f1 too,, 6t is better in everything. worth paying more.. )
*Now the Issues are..
1. Lack of 3.5mm jack which can be a deal breaker for many people. But honestly not for me. Because i don't have a wired earphone or headphone. It's 2k18 even my car doesn't have an aux port. (Android auto). If still u want to use then there is a connector comes with the box.
2 . Notification led.
If they provided a led on the top of display then you have to compromise with that beautiful notch.
Again not a deal breaker.
*Important*
I have seen many people are saying in reviews. That they have not received cash back or type c bullet earphones with box. Not sure about. The cash back. But. If you pre book this device. It is mentioned that u will receive a code to purchase those earphones by 15 nov. U will not get those with the box..
And about the cash back i had purchased it at rs 46k(8ram 256rom) nd i received that 1000 instantly nd 500 on 5th nov.
Chaliye ab kuch buraiya bhi karde
*Sound quality can be better..
*Not ip certified. It is just splash proof (but i don't know how to swim so I'm not taking my phone in pool... again not a deal breaker)
Buss ab kharid lia or burai nhi hoti.",Farzeen Rais,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Send me,I did prebook but I don't get bullet earphones,Abhi,15 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Still Value For Money and great phone but now price is on edge.,"Overall amazing product for the price point .. but now its on the edge. One plus has been slowly increasing prices year on year and now they are in INR40K range. Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.
Regarding phone:
Superb edge to edge display & battery life - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.
Software: Oxygen OS - as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.
Build Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there's noticeable difference in weight).
Fingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.
Only cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds ""No 3.5mm headphone Jack"" - nothing to describe here.
But overall its a good package and still its a Value for money! You can go for it for sure.",Gadgito!,5 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Bug with downloading apps,I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps,Amazo,4 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Just buy this phone!!!!,"Absolutely top notch phone!!! No need for big reviews with pros and cons. Just know that the pros are almost everything and cons are mostly limited to minor s/w bugs. This Onpelus keeps fixing very fast with OTA updates. Previously my only issue was that of Android OS updates as Oneplus was very slow or never pushed updates. This comes with the latest version of android and hoping for faster updates in the future.
Battery life is legendary... Getting close to 6 hrs of SOT nd that's just phenomenal.
Camera is great, may not compete with the pixel but who wants to anyway. At the price its just great.
Lack of a headphone jack is a definite letdown but keep the in box dongle fixed to your existing earphones or upgrade to some good Bluetooth headsets during sale.
Have not seen any major issues yet and performance is very smooth and super fast.
The animations may feel a bit too buttery for some, in such cases go for changing animation scale in the developer options.
Overall fantastic ... As subject says... Just buy this!!",Manjunath M Patil,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Crafted with passion,"This device is clearly ahead of its pack for the hardware and features provided in this price range. Since everyone is well aware of the specs I'll just provide my experience while using this device.
1. Sharp well balanced pictures during daytime and nightscape mode does a decent effort to reduce graininess and camera shake while taking night shots with low ISO settings. Still room for improvement though.
2. As for sound quality I never use phone speakers while listening to music and prefer my Bluetooth headphones as I hate wires. I'm glad headphone jack is absent. One less vestigial organ to worry about as we move forward. Thank you oneplus. Call clarity is good as expected.
3. Marriage of bloatfree oxygen os alongwith snapdragon 845 makes this phone a pure joy to use. Fast snappy and responsive! In screen fingerprint sensor though takes more time to unlock than the physical one at the back earlier, but this has been hid well by the animations provided.
4. Battery life is excellent and I'm using dark theme which further reduces battery consumption. Gives me more than one day of usage without playing any games.
5. Body has been exquisitely crafted and with the gorilla 6 screen and teardrop notch this is one of the best displays you can get at present. I would have still preferred a metal unibody instead of the glass back though.
All in all I would say you'd feel proud and satisfied to own this device. If you can shell out the extra dough go for the 8 gb versions. Thumbs up to Oneplus for another great product and for not ""settling"" !",SAM,7 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Not satisfied,Phone is good and phone sound was very good but battery is very bad I am not satisfied this phone,Rakesh ng,7 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

Hello Guys, it’s been 1 week since I got (8GB/256GB) one of the best phone in market. As expected OnePlus deliver customs expectations.
Regarding phone it’s of course best in the market, battery charging takes around 75 minutes from 5% to 100%. Discharging is pretty normal compared to its competitors. Photo clarity is good enough in normal/ portrait mode but night mode I don’t feel good enough, it takes longer time to stabilise and we need to hold and wait. Video and photo clarity is good but not the best in market or less comparatively than my Lumia 950XL. Fingerprint sensor is not much sensitive and takes .5 to 1 sec to open, had a angle problem which resolved in recent update but still lag remains same. Face recognition is perfect. I feel phone is in top 5 for gaming with separate gaming mode, don’t see any lag in WCC 2/ Asphalt/ PUBG. Screen size, display is pretty good and as expected. Sound quality is same as it’s lower end models no much difference. Overall I am happy with other specifics except night mode, fingerprint sensor.",Rajesh,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Not a flagship killer.,"Battery life is very disappointing even it is increased by 400mah.
Other features are good. Built quality is good.
Product delivery is great.
Night mode camera quality is average.
Last but the least heating issue is also that cannot be ignored. We are facing little bit to moderate heating back panel on even normal usage.",Imran,6 November 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars
Very average,"1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.
2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.
3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive.",C s oberoi,5 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars
Good smartphone with some minor glitches!,"Purchased the One Plus 6T from Amazon yesterday.
It's a great smartphone, a flagship killer. Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
1) Great super AMOLED display, with high screen to aspect ratio and notch hiding option.
2) Good camera with life like colours, with OIS/EIS making video shooting stable.
3)Good battery life.
4) Fast processor and an easy to use OS, with no unnecessary bloatware.
5) Charging is fast and hassle free, like all One Plus phones.
6) Fingerprint and face unlock is simultaneous, and reasonably fast.
7) Absence of notification light is not missed, rather it's a blessing in disguise !
Cons:
1) Too heavy, fingers hurt after holding it for some time.
2) Screen flash for the selfie camera takes lighted, but grainy photos in pitch darkness. The Vivo V11 Pro selfie camera also uses screen flash,but the photos are less grainy.
3) Poor ring tone selection, you have to download ring tones.
4) No in built FM radio.
5) Good sound output, but mono non stereo sound coming from 1 speaker.
6) Potrait mode / Bokeh effect snaps are just average, both for the front and rear cameras, background contrast is poor and uneven. The Vivo V11 Pro takes better potrait photos.
7) Mirror black version and the plastic cover is prone to fingerprint smudges and attracts dust. It has to be wiped regularly with a cloth.
As you can see however, the cons are nothing major, and overall,its a great value-for-money phone!",Dipankar Chatterjee,8 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:
(a) Only big screen, big battery & big memory as compared to its previous model and nothing else.
(b) User friendly for left hand sider.
The Markeable Cons:
(a) No LED notification. Very Sad.
(b) In-finger print sensor is not good as compared to its previous model. To unlock the phone you will have to place your finger accurately.
(c) In-finger print sensor delayed by 0.5/1 second as compared to its previous model.
(d) Face unlock system is very poor and not capacitive. It doesn't work in dark.

Not so Good Not so bad,"Hello Guys,
I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.
1- battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.
2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.
3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.
4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed in 20k phone easily.
5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.
Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and
2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.
If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.

The best phone I have every used.,"A big fan of oneplus. This is so far the best from oneplus. The stock android and with oxygen OS makes your phone experience as smooth as it can ever be. The camera is very decent. The nightscape mode is okay, i miss the pro mode that was better but its okay. For gaming purposes this phone is a monster. Pubg or asphalt there is no lag. You will forget what does the word hanging means. The face unlock is super accurate even works in night.
Just buy it. Battery lasts all most 2 days.",Umesh,5 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
"""Flagship Killer"" as Advertised","OnePlus 6T is my first OnePlus device and I'm in love with this phone, 6T is the fastest flagship phone I have used till date I'm saying this dispute being a Apple Sheep for some time. OP6T has good battery life, Powerful processor for fast multitasking, amazing Graphic Processing power that can chew through graphic intense Games like PUBG-M,Fortnite and Asphalt 9 with ease, The Phone has good RAM management, decently loud speakers, Dash Charging works as advertised, OLED Display is decent with accurate colour reproduction, Tear Drop Notch is non-intrusive during Gaming and watching Movies (Though you have options to completly hide it), Thin side Bezel smaller chin add a very immersive experience during enjoying videos streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, APV, Twitch, etc.. dispite the lower availability of content that would take advantage of the phones aspect ratio.
The phone dose comes with few Bloatwares which can be uninstalled, Oxygen OS is simple to use & as close to stock Android OS.
Call Quality, cellular connectivity, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth are excellent.
In-display Fingerprint scanner ""Just works"" with blazing fast Facial unlock.
Camera is perfect in segment with ability to shoot decent photographs and 4K videos @60FPS.
The Phone is well built/designed with Glossy Glass Body that gives it a premium feel and look.
Amazon Delivery was fast dispite my remote location.",Rahul Kr. Bain,11 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
"A true flagship, amazingly snappy & powerful! Software needs improvement.","As Oneplus says ""Never Settle"", its true for the 1+ 6T as well. My first 1+ phone & the experience has been great till now. No lags, no slowdowns, no glitches, extremely snappy & powerful. I feel lucky using this phone. Its got the latest powerhouse sdm 845 inside with 8GB(my variant) ram which blazes through games & multitasking. The display is amazing & as its an Amoled screen, the colours are very punchy & saturated as well. Watching videos on my 6T is a true blessing. Everything seems so vivid & beautiful that i don't feel like watching movies on a television anymore. The screen is pretty big (6.41in) & the tear drop style notch makes it infact more immersive. The sound quality is very decent & the speaker is pretty loud despite being mono. The camera is amazing too which brings out decent looking pictures with fast focusing speed. Low light pictures are very decent as well & its not justified to expect anything more from a smartphone of this price tag. It very much lives up to the expectations. I would like to highlight one drawback though having Android 9(pie), some of the many apps & games on the play store doesn't seem to be well optimised for this new version of android & hence we might need to wait a few more weeks untill the developers of these apps optimise them better for the newer version of android which will then make the software experience even better. The software experience can be annoyingly slow at times which is unexpected from Oxygen OS on SDM 845. Seriously the software needs to be improved. Application load times, opening notifications, loading games seem pretty slow for a phone with a snapdragon 845 with 8GB Ram & UFS 2.1 storage.",Nilanjan Paul,13 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Pathetic camera phone,"Camera is pathetic. Takes blurry pics sometimes. Pics gets detoriarated on little bit of zooming also. Looks like its a 8mp camera. Samsung takes better pics even in 8k phone. Low light is equally bad. Poor selfie camera. Those saying awesome camera have no idea about cameras. Improve camera performance in the next update.

Best phone for the budget,"The packing was very bad there was no protection layer around the box to prevent damage the box was just wrapped with a cover and so my onplus box was damaged on all sides while taking delivery
Oneplus 6t is a premium range smartphone u couldn't defenetly get a better phone at this price.I was upgrading from my 2 yr old oneplus 3 and this one is defenetly better in terms of display. 6t has crispier display though i am not a fan of the notch . Camera is very good for the price with good detailing.Battery backup is fair as it would defenetly last a days of use.They shouldn't have removed the headphone jack.Sound quality is awesome.
The drawbacks are they could have included ip certitication and included the headphone jack
With oneplus rolling out software updates regularly the phone would run smoothly for years",Sandeep Prakash,7 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
OnePlus Great.,"I purchased the phone on the 1/11/2018. I have purchased one plus 6 on 24/08/18. When I had received my OnePlus 6 and started using it my joy was countless. After years of tradition of using Moto phones I upgraded here. The OnePlus 6 is a seamless ph with many good things. Within months I upgraded to OnePlus 6t. OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6 t are basically the same phone. It's not much worth upgrading. Both has oxygen 9, same camera, even night mode is available here. Comparatively 6 is lighter and can be held better in hands than 6t. Software no difference. Difference is battery n minimum storage, Tear drop notch. Overall the pH cannot be compared with anyone. It's a giant in itself. Smooth touch, good camera, fast touch responses, everything is very nice. It is difficult cto bring the experience in writing. It should be felt. It's worth to use the phone.",Prasenjeet,10 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

One plus 6T fundamentally great phone,"One Plus 6T is the best phones from one plus. Some of the pros and cons of the phone is
Pros
New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge
Up-to-date, versatile OS
Fast Charge is still great
Sleek, premium design
Great performance
Great battery life
Cons
Camera's Nightscape mode needs work
Fingerprint sensor needs refinement
One plus 6t has one of the best display in the phone in its range and even gives tough competition to some other high end phones. Camera is one of the best highlight of this phone adding Night scape mode gave its camera edge over other phones. But taking photos on Night scape mode is too slow one plus has to work on it.
In display finger print sensor it is one of the highlight of this phone but one plus has to work on it refinement. Recently one plus has one given one upgrade to fix slowness problem in Indisplay finger sensor. Now it fast but still need improvement. Phone is super smooth no lags nothing even playing high end games. Dash charing is super quick 35 - 45 minutes is enough for full charging.",Rakesh,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
The Speed You Need,"Premium feel, Super fast processing, Super smooth UI, Impressive battery life going on 1 and half day on normal usage and one full day on intense usage, Camera quality is phenomenal, Sound quality is great, Face recognition is fastest possible and works in the dark also. OnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T.",Jayaraj Vijayan,15 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Beast mode on!,"My earlier OP phone gave up on my a little while ago and I wasn't sure if I should wait for the 6T to launch or just go for another phone. I'm glad I waited. The OP 6T is a beast of a device. The screen is just beautiful and the gestures so smooth. Using the device is just a satisfying experience. The battery life is also incredible. Easily gets me through two days of average usage. The finger print reader is slightly slower compared to other devices with regular scanners, but its not something to be put off by. The only con I have about the device is the single downward facing speaker. It can easily be covered depending on how you hold the phone so not really a great experience while watching something especially in landscape mode. Otherwise, don't think twice about getting this phone. Just go for it.",Jeromie Fernandes,10 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Why I have no choice except love One plus 6T!,"It's simply a burdenless phone.Very user friendly and the oxygen os user interface is ineffably smooth.
Nice touch of elegance and strength.
Touch delay is almost zero and in performance it's a real life hero.Beauty performance and simplicity are the distinct features of this dark knight.
Fast and furious android experience mesmerized me and now it is an inseperable limb of my digital life!
I love it because I have no other choice.
Hope one plus make it more featuristic and usable because it's not only their business but also their social responsibility as this is the only brand which thinks not only to maximise the profit of the organisation but also the utility of the loyal and precious customers of them them.

POOR BATTERY LIFE,"Oneplus has always been my favourite device.
I owned a oneplus 6 and i was happy back then. The biggest mistake i made was when upgraded to oneplus 6t.
camera is quite similar to oneplus 6
device functions almost as smooth as oneplus 6
BUT BATTERY!!!!!! THE BATTERY IS A BUMMER...
battery drains so quickly. battery lasts longer only when the data is turned off,and i stick to only making/attending calls.
1 hour of usage <whatsapp/facebook> and the battery reduces to 50%
1 single game , and battery reduces by 12-15%
i mean, why would anyone want to pay 38000 for a device thats good only for attending/making calls alone????
rated 3 stars only because oneplus has been my personal favourite of all time",secureit,10 November 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars
Simply Fantastic/Awesome. It's really an worthy buy ...,"First of all thanks to Amazon for getting this product delivered within 24 hours time. It was an amazing experience starting from opening the kit and experiencing the same.
Fantastic display & build quality. Terrific camera with good support of nightscape function. Big battery lasting for the day and on. Operation moves like "" makkhan "" without glitch. Special mention of one plus switch software for transfer of date from my earlier phone to new one. Lastly awesome sound in the headset though speaker sounds little louder.
Never mind it doesn't have round Jack for headset and also absent of LED notification.
I can definitely forget the above two against those beautiful features the One plus 6T offers.
Great kudos to one plus team!!",bijoy,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Best premium smartphone in lower range.,"I like each and every feature of this device especially the battery life is very good and this sound is higher than my old oneplus 3.
Also I am feeling very lucky after getting this product I always trusted oneplus from the beginning and I am the proud owner of all the oneplus devices and specially I recommended this product to my father uncle and all my brothers and now they all having oneplus devices.",Asif Rais,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Perfection,"I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast. CNET mentioned it as ""Hero phone without sky high Price"". It's true. At this price range it's a great value for money. OnePlusen launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.
Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.
Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.
Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.
The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it).
In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.
Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.
Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.
Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.
Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I've ordered 3 of them 😁 let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.
The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass.
Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day's time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus.",Karthik R Nithyanandam,7 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Compromise on the headphone jack and you get so much more.,"Pros:
Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.
Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.
Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.
I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.
Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :D
coming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).
It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.
Ummm what else....
Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.
But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..
Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...
But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.
Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!
Cons:
The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.
Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.
The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!
It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!
Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!

Premium experience without burning your wallet,"Completely satisfied with the phone, already multiple reviews have been given on the phone so I would touch on my personal opinion alone. Amazon has to take care of the package delivery. The box was crushed almost on all sides. It's high time they focus on package quality. Zero star for this to Amazon, you're lucky if the phone comes in a single piece because the way the box looked I was really worried but luck was on my side. Thank God !!!
*Pros*
1. Premium feel
2. Camera the best
3. Speed, it is really fast enough
4. User friendly OS and latest Android
5. Battery and dash charging (15mins tips from 0 to 75% of battery)
6. In display finger print is fast once you get used with right angle and spot. Trust me it is fast
7. Annoying notification light is gone. As an alternative one tap on screen gives all notification
*Cons*
1. 3.5mm jack missing, may be we'll get used to it
2. The dongle provided for 3.5mm jack is very thin, the wire is easily tend to break. Could have been thicker like the charger wire
3. YouTube and play store often doesn't work with WiFi whereas via mobile data it works flawlessly. Hope an update will rectify this issue
** Amazon put some quality time on package department**",Sabari,12 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
The best phone you can get for this price,"Got my phone in less than 24hours. What does the package contain:
1) Charger adapter and cable
2) 3.5mm jack convertor
3) A nice and firm back case
Note that the phone also comes with the screen guard pre applied which I find great as we don't have to order it separately and most importantly get rid of the pain of applying it.
Cons:
1) camera: great picture quality and software with handy modes- now some people will say they could find a even more better camera with pixel but they tend to forget the price difference.
2) battery: it comes with 3700mah battery which easily covers an entire day for me with high screen usage.
3) Finger print sensor :istantly unlocks
4) sound quality is also very good and will never disappoint anyone.
Cons:
Nothing except the headset..it would be a perfect package if one plus can include headset along with the box..",Jeba,26 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great phone , speaker is a let down","Finally I moved from iOS to android and oneplus was my first choice .amazon did a fast delivery.
Well I will start with what I feel I didn’t like ....
1) speaker is not good ....from iPhone coming to oneplus flagship u need much more better speaker
Other than this I am happy with the phone till now as this is my second day of use
Many feel headphone jack abscence is bad well, for me I hardely use them so ok for me .
Battery well if you use a week internet then it will drain fast ...at higher speed I saw it was working great 20 minutes of YouTube and 15 minutes of gaming it just dropped 7% . So it’s ok
Coming to notification light ...it does pops up the notification u need to activate them .
Finger print lock ...well if you lift ur finger too fast it won’t detect ...otherwise it’s fast , face unlock is very fast ....face unlock in dark will also work but u need to activate those from settings ....for those who have doubt go to YouTube and see tips for oneplus 6t .a video in 2 parts are there it will help you in all the settings
There is also option for hidden apps which is great feature
Camera is good ,
Big phone as I just ditched iPhone 6 so getting adjusted to it .
So all over it’s a great phone , if anyone have any question u can ask me here I will respond

Truly Elegant 🍻💯,"Literally as they mentioned ""Unlock The Speed"". Very true. Phone is so good. After upgrading from OnePlus3T to OnePlus6T, I've been mesmerized by the phone camera. This is so cool. Compared to battery life, it's pretty better than the previous version, i.e - OnePlus3T. Battery is 3700 mAH polymer battery with fast charge.
Colour display is also epic. 🍻. I chose Midnight Black. Looks Stunning. My games run so smoothly. PUBG runs like bullet. 🍻
My overall review after accessing this Masterpiece. I've upgraded from OnePlus3T to OnePlus6T for the only purpose. That's Camera. Just class. 🍻
The only thing that disappointed me that the OnePlus bullets wireless earphones wasn't included with it.
Pros :
* Battery life is good.
* Good processor.
* Amazing Performance.
* Dual Camera with Portrait Mode & Studio Lighting.
* Dash Charge. One day's charge within few hours.
* Finger Scanner in display is Epic. Super fast. 🍻
Cons :
No Notification LED
OnePlus bullets wireless earphones not included with the package.
Overall rating :
Performance : 10/10
Sound Quality : 10/10
Screen size : 10/10
Face Unlock : 10/10
OS : 10/10
Front Camera : 10/10
Rear Camera : 10/10
Battery : 9/10
I was using OnePlus3T & I was waiting for a long time for this beast to come out. Features are beyond good & this is the best & powerful device so far for Android Versions. If you're seeking a phone that's fast & multitasking & upto the mark for speed & performance, this is the one as the processor is beyond Epic if you compare with other Android devices. One of the latest devices for Android platforms & at very affordable price. Totally worth. 🍻
Truly I have no regrets buying this sexy beast. 🍻 💯
Worth all your money 💰💵
Bought this with Acko protection plan & it's worth the deal. 🍻 💯

Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works well. Face recognition is snappy.

In complex words, REALLY FAST!
Unlocks like a dream, performs like there’s no tomorrow.
The in-display finger-print scanner is very quick, but isn’t a match to One Plus 6’s physical scanner. Nonetheless, this is a technology which had to be explored.
If you own a One Plus 6 already, then you shouldn’t worry. For others, you got to check this out, because this is value for money and delivers the speed that you DESERVE!",Sunil R S.,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Best android phone in market . Go for it!!,"I was skeptical in moving from iphone to oneplus. But after using for almost 1 weeks and loading it with tons of apps, i can say. This is truely a flagship killer phone.. camera, battery, display is mesmerizing. Games like pubg, asphalt, pes runs smoothly, thanks to Gaming mode. It also has the latest snapdragon which enhances the performance. The indisplay fingerprint is little bit slower but its acceptable as its 1st generation. But the face unlock is ridiculously fast. Full screen display with waterdrop notch & amloed display is really eye catchy. Only issue is the screen is little insensitive around the corners. Thanks to oneplus to provide Super fast Rapid charger and type C to 3.5 mm jack connector which helps to connect the old earphones with jack. The translucent cover and the pre applied screenguard is really of superior quality and saves some of your extra bucks. Lastly oxygen os and out of box Android Pie seems to b a perfect match & will give u a smooth experience.",Dinesh,16 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
One plus 6t feedback after 15 days usage.,This is really nice product. There are certain drawback like no led notification and no always on display despite having smiled screen. But overall it is very nice and fluid to use. Camera are same as earlier. Night scape mode may not be the best but it still way better than anything else in this price bracket. Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices. And I must say that it is really fluid and battery life exceptional now with 3700 mah. With moderate usage I am always getting screen on time of anywhere between 6 to 7 hrs so with normal moderate use it will always last you for a day and half. In display fingerprint scanner may not be fastest and always accurate but it is still unique and serve the purpose. Overall a good clean android performance phone to have.,Aseem kohli,14 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Good phone with compromise,"The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of 3.5 headphone jack and notification led. The usb C- headphone jack adapter is in noway an alternative. Similarly, people will expect a stereo speaker on a phone of this price range -- even Poco F1 and Asus Zenfone 5Z provide it at a much lower cost. Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light.",Dr. Tarak Khan,12 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Thanks,

Powerful beast! With some cons,"Pros:
+Zero lag , great battery 5*
+camera is superb as similar to previous version, though has some soft upgrades. 5*
+Dash Charging is super cool. 5*
+Display is the best you can get for this price range! 4*
+S845 is undoubtedly powerful and apps load and work seamlessly 5*
+Great gaming experience ( with not much of heating issue & battery drain) 5*
+Great sound quality (5*)
Cons:
-Indisplay fingerprint scanner seems not a very useful thing. Its difficult to use it (better go with face unlock). It will be much better only if you add all 10 fingers :-) 3*
-Fingerprint scanning is comparatively slow (lot of catchy graphics) and sometimes delayed if a wrong finger was used. 2*
-Using without a cover is too risky - the back cover is very slippery . But using a cover the phone looses its identity though.
-No AUX port, though a type-C to AUX cable is provided with the pack, carrying it all the time is difficult .
overall, its a very nice phone and I'm just getting used to it. So far so good.
--UPDATE--
I have used the phone for almost 20 days now, here are some more insights on the device
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I got the Type-C bullet headphones after 15 days, but I'm just disappointed because it does not have the class. Its like a cheap headphone you can get for ~300-400 (I got it free, so can't complain though)
-I face frequent difficulties in connecting to the Car bluetooth Audio (I use SYNC on FORD).
-Battery life and Charging is very good.
-Crashed 2 times (seems to be a kernel panic) and rebooted while listening to music with full volume (not sure of reason)
-Gaming experience is one of the best. Never had a glitch.
-Low light face detection is not good.
-Camera is better if you install Google Camera ( OnePlus camera is not bad)",Kris,7 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Superb! But has some issues!,"Oneplus 6T is the best phone you can get with less than half the price of iPhones.
All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)
CONs:
Fingerprint sensor - slower than previous models + you need the screen to be switched on before using the fingerprint
Headphone jack removed & extension chord is provided. This is a big let down!

Defective product,I got a defective product,Adarsh Gajanan,5 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Great value for money product...,"Let's start with the notch as this is my first time with a notch device...
I'm not a fan of notches but the notch that comes with this device doesn't come across (to me at least) as irritating... The teardrop shape blends in quite well with the rest of the body of the device...
The device is as smooth & fluid as you would expect from OnePlus and the face recognition works incredibly fast... The good part that I discovered about the face unlock feature is that I registered my face without my glasses but it still recognizes me and unlocks the phone every time... So no worries with it leaving you hanging after a tough day when you can't be bothered to look carefully at your device for the face unlock to work...
That brings me to the in-display fingerprint scanner... In most situations the face unlock is too quick and so I don't even need to use it but the scanner on itself works just ok... It's nowhere near as fast as the modern day fingerprint scanners on the backs of devices and the unlock speed of this phone with fingerprint is around the same as my OnePlus 2 from 2015... The only advantage is that the huge display you get and it's quite something to see up close (for me)...
Battery life is incredible as well... I charge it for about 45mins to an hour everyday and it lasts me the whole day... Although I would say that I'm not a very hardcore phone user like I used to be but the phone lives up to it's expectation as you would want... Look up reviews on YT if you're really interested in getting this device...
Picture quality is great in the phone, far greater than I could imagine... Takes clear shots and the slow motion also looks amazing... It just gets a little heated up after you shoot in slowmo or take a video in 4k-60FPS...
Sound quality is as usual from the outside speakers and there's no headphone jack... It's annoying of course and so I've got a separate pair of earphones for specifically this phone and have connected the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter to it... I don't take it off and so that we way I'm less likely to loose it... So that takes care of the little issue...
And yeah, the device is waterproof actually... Even though there isn't any official certification, it's waterproof to a decent extent...
The only thing I wish to be changed about this device for now is the placement of the volume button... Unlike my previous OnePlus 2, they put the alert slider above the power button and the volume button on the left for the OnePlus 6T...
This gets extremely weird from what was just working fine (volume button above the power button and alert slider in the left) in my opinion but that's just my personal bias...
Overall the phone is definitely a fantastic package for the price...",Deb Kumar Dasgupta,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Unlocking speed in a new way!,"The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.
The display is a 6.41-inch AMOLED panel having 19.6:9 aspect ratio. Thanks to its 85.6% screen to body ratio, the phone doesn’t feel large in hand despite the big screen size.
There’s no upgrade in the display resolution this time as well. It has a full HD (2340 x 1080p) display with 402ppi pixel density. But in all honesty, the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 6T still offers gorgeous picture quality. The colors pop, it looks immersive and there’s no compromise with the details.
The back of the phone is relatively cleaner, as there is only the camera setup since the fingerprint is moved under the display. On the right edge of the phone is a power on button, which is one of your options for waking the device – the other is a double tap on the screen - and above that is the signature OnePlus slider that allows you to mute your phone with a quick flick.
OnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T. The company uses a 3D glass back on the phone which looks great without compromising with the essentials.

Fluid performance

Samsung Fan Switching to OnePlus,"I have been using Samsung Flagships all my life. Switching to OnePlus was a nervous decision but it made all the difference.
OnePlus does everything better. (except Camera - which I hope will get better in future).
Samsung just cannot compete with the performance and endurance of OnePlus.
Although Samsung phones feel more premium in the hand, but everything else in OnePlus far outweighs the lack of supreme build quality.
A good decision for sure!",Narinder,13 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Read this before you purchase OnePlus 6T,"Switched from 3t to 6t 256 gb. This phone is probably the best in the market. Battery is phenomenal. Headphone jack? All those people saying that no headphone jack are probably bunch of idiots. And the reason why I am saying that is there is a headphone jack, that charger jack because I myself was skeptical about it but you don't need to charge and listen to music since charging is so fast you'll probably just need to wait for 10-15 minutes for a long hour usage. Best phone hands down. AND THE INCREASE IN BATTERY LIFE CAN BE SEEN EASILY. I PLAYED PUBG 5 MATCHES, THEN WATCHED A MOVIE ON THE PHONE AND EVEN THEN THERE WAS A GOOD AMOUNT OF BATTERY PERCENTAGE LEFT. AND the finger print. Haha, This is the best part. Indisplay fingerprint is very fast. And the implementation of a fingerprint inside a display is phenomenal with the speed OnePlus has given since it doesn't really take time to open. The GESTURES are exactly what I needed. Use OnePlus gestures instead of Google and it is totally worth it. Speakers are pretty loud even though there is one faux speaker for the aesthetics.
Overall? This phone is miles ahead of OnePlus 6 with
Better notch(the best implementation of notch and completely distinguished itself from the rest)
Bigger battery

Amazing phone,"What an amazing device. The price is justified what it offers. Believe me it may not be a better looking phone out there among the flagships, but I bet it's a better phone to live with compared to others, the reason being the polished software. It's a low priced pixel, with more functionality. The super slow motion is great. The notch in fact is it's beauty spot. Display is great. Camera good. In display finger print reader works like a charm. Battery life amazing. Personally my only complaint is huge size of the phone.",Prime 47,10 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Device is worth every penny.,"Best buy i ever have. Totally impressed buy the phone.
Screen quality is so good so are the viewing angles as it's an OLED panel.
Battery life is also decent. I am getting 7:30-8:00 hours screen on time countinously on moderate usage. Though i am not worried of the battery drain 'coz dash charging is very fast and within 1:30 hours phone is completely charged.
Picture quality is also good considering the price of the device. Though i am not a camera loving person.
Oneplus 6t is beast in performance. What else can i say about the device. It is very fast and lag free.
Oxygen os is better then stock google android even gestures are much better then pixel 3&3xl.
Sound quality is also good. It has only one speaker but the output is quite good enough.
Indispaly Finger print is acceptable. It is not as fast as the usual rear fingerprint scanner but does the job.
Those who have oneplus 6 can wait for oneplus7 as it is just an incrememtal upgrade.",Sumit,13 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Overheating,The phone is a flagship killer.. but it too have flaws... After unboxing and using it for an hour the phone started to over heat... Till now it is overheating. Battery standby is also not good.. for normal usage also u have to wrap this phone with a cloth to get use to the heat.. hope this is a software glitch and expext a software update soon which may resolve this issue... Camera quality is nice specially the night mode .,whozefa4k,7 November 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars

Android Pie + Oxygen Os makes the phone smooth and easy to use.
Cons:
The Screen is a fingerprint magnet.
The brightness is not quiet bright.

Amazing phone - VALUE FOR MONEY,"I am using this phone for a week. here are my views on this phone.
screen - AMOLED screen, colors are vivid and pics look beautiful in this screen. brightness can be adjusted from very dark and very bright which makes it easy to use in night and in sunlight.
battery- 3700mah - last more than a day. using dash charging is awesome. it charges so quickly.
software - fast and fluid. close to native android and bug free. Already got 2 updates and gestures support.
finger print scanner - bit slow than traditional one but it is perfectly usable in day to day life. works perfect everytime.
camera - nightscape feature is useful to take pics in very dark situation. i installed google camera and used night sight feature. night sight feature is much advanced and takes more bright pics than nightscape mode. but am happy that one plus may improve this feature in next software update. pics taken in daylight is awesome and portrait mode is also very nice.
headphone jack - 3.5mm jack is missing but adapter is given in box. Audio quality is very good for average user and speaker loudness is appreciable enough to fill a room.
Overall you can never get disappointed with this phone. it delivers in all spheres and easily one of the best phone among flagships and available at affordable price tag.

"If you can afford it, just go for it.","While there are some drawbacks, the other features overcome them easily.
The OnePlus 6T is One of the Fastest Phones in The World Right Now.
Fantastic Battery Backup, Amazing Display, Even Better Under-display Fingerprint Scanner and Premium looks; all together make this a beast to claim.
Although the price is a bit higher but if you can tolerate that, then this is the one that I'd recommend. P.s. Pixel 3 and Px 3 XL are even more costlier than the highest end variant of this phone.
No need to upgrade if you own a OnePlus 6bor even 5T. But those who are using an outdated phone like me, this is the best upgrade currently available.

Got the product after 12 days of order!!!!!,"Review After 10 Days of usage
Amazon transportation team- I have ordered it on November 2th as part of launch offer.
It was supposed to deliver within 2 days to Bangalore. But it didn’t happen. After multiple call to customer care I got to know that product has lost in transit. Again they have sent a replacement and promised a one day
Guaranteed delivery. That also didn’t happen. So totally I had to wait 12 days from the order to get the beast in my hand.
Package- As you can see for a product around 39000 K they didn’t even put a bubble wrap on my product.
By luck I got the phone without crack.
OnePlus 6T- Absolutely amazing phone which works like champ.
Battery- I am getting 2 day back up with single sim, dark mode on and normal usage like
Facebook, YouTube, 2 hours of call etc. Dash charging will make you surprised with the speed.
Design- I didn’t get the mate black for 6GB/128GB version. Mirror black always tend to slip and fingerprint magnet.
So put a skin on it. It looks more premium and handy now.
Camera- I would say it as descent since telephoto lens rivals are on market. 240 FPS slow motion video rocks.
No 3.5 mm audio jack. A bit disappointment.
Overall it’s a good investment on those who are planning for an upgrade from other brands.
Happy with one OP6T overall",Rakesh,22 November 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars
Speedy and Good Battery life,"Switching between apps / multitasking is a breeze.. The phone is damn fast..

Also it comes with a flash type c charger (Full charge in 45 mins)

Oneplus 6T is having smooth navigation, hell lot of features dont know whether everyone uses all the features or not. Pics taken from the camera are awesome. Battery life is good, super fast charging. Phone size is also good while holding the phone with one hand.

True Flagship Killer,"I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:
Pros:
i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.
ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.
iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.
iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.
v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.
vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.
Cons:
i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)
ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.
iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyes
Overall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.

"OnePlus fan, upgraded from OP3","As I'm upgraded from OP3 by seeing the beauty of OP6T. The OP3 is 2 years old & it's running well without even a scratch in screen after falling 4 or 5 times. But when I saw OP6T I fall in love with the beauty & features, especially in screen finger print. It's super fast. Then moving to camera it's outstanding, if it's portrait, night mode, whatever it is. Just like OP3 it's not giving a chance for lag in any circumstances. Battery is enough for one day & no worries there is rapid charge. I will be a OnePlus fan ever 😍.",Nikz,12 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Bang on !!,"The first impression about the phone is that it feels premium in hand. I bought the 6GB, 128 GB, mirror black version.
PROS :
- Premium feel,
- Super fast processing,
- Super smooth UI,
- Impressive battery life going on 1 and half day on normal usage and one full day on intense usage,
- Camera quality is phenomenal,
- Sound quality is great,
- Face recognition is fastest possible and works in the dark also,
CONS :
- Has very slippery back, can't be used in daily routine without a back cover,
- Water drop notch doesn't feel that good (it is my personal view),
- Notification bar is unreachable on single hand use,
- Sometimes I struggle to hear the voice on call, I don't know if it is because of the earpiece positioning or I am not used to of having a phone this big,
- The ""On screen fingerprint sensor"" is not that fast, it took around 2 seconds to unlock at first but now taking lesser after update. But still, not fast as the physical sensor. Secondly, it doesn't recognise the fingerprint sometimes so that I have to reposition my finger. I barely use it because it has face recognition which is fastest.
Overall, it is one of the best phones Available in the market.",Pundreek dwivedi,14 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Brilliant Phone,"I am a OnePlus One user who upgraded to this phone. Considering this fact, I am loving this phone. It's been 4 days since I got OnePlus 6T and I have charged only a couple of times for an hour or so each time; the battery is just brilliant. If you are someone who loves to click pictures and take selfies, you won't be disappointed with the various features of the camera in this phone. I got 6 gigs of ram and 128 storage space in this phone, and it's damn quick and no lags or hangs so far! If you don't like the notch, not to worry, you will be able to disable it.
One major disappointment was the 3.5mm jack's death. However, with their Type-C headphone adapter, you can manage to plug in your 3.5mm headphones.
Lastly, if you are someone who's upgrading from OnePlus 3rd Gen., 5th Gen., or 6, consider waiting for the next phone from OnePlus.",Mahesh,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Review after using extensively for 10 days,"Like the tagline says #NeverSettle stands with this flagship killer. I was an iOS user, after great hesitant I had to move to Android due to Apple's #HighCostNoValue motto.
Pros:
- Amazing full display
- Top notch build quality
- Fluidless OxygenOS
- Big battery which will go more than a day even after playing games (PUBG) for long time
- Fast charging (Love this feature)
- Stylish panel
- Flawlerss gaming experience, zero lags.
- Infinite features compare to Apple
Cons:
- No Stereo speaker. A single speaker will block the sound completely if you are playing a game and you cover the speaker by your hand
- No headphone Jack (Works for me as I use bluetooth headset)
- Low light photography needs an improvement
- In built finger print is not fast than the normal fingerprint scanner.
Face unlock will unlock your phone faster than the fingerprint scanner.
I personally feel this technology was not needed at all.
Thats all as of now, will update the list after few months.

Battery life sucks.,"At first I was very excited to purchase this phone coz everyone was talking about it how good it is, how fast it is. Moreover I was also very eager to own this phone. I placed the order and thanks to Amazon timely delivery, I got this product the next day. I've been using this phone from last 2 days and lemme tell you guys, the battery sucks and the finger lock and face unlock features are not fast enough as they are advertised. I don't even play heavy games on my phone apart from candy crush but the battery hardly last for half a day which quite frankly sucks as it has a larger battery of 3700 MAH. Feeling really disappointed and hoping that one plus will fix these problems in thr next update.
Apart from that, the phone speed is good and the apps are working just great. I guess after spending 38K, I feel cheated now.",Nazim,4 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars
Worst camera and battery,"I purchased this one n get it on monday. However I am completely dissatisfied with the performance. The way OnePlus advertised this 6T is not at all matching what it delivers now. The ""picture quality"" is not at all even good. Even on 10% zoom the picture pixel breaks completely. Currently I am using a nexus 5X. I compared the picture taken in nexus 5x to that of 6T and the result is - picture taken in nexus 5x is way more better then this 6T.
Next I charged the phone 75% didn't even use for anything coz till now I didn't configure my phone completely(still using nexus for most of work) then by evening the battery dropped to 47%. Hardly I had 2 call of max 5min.
The screen resolution is also not quite satisfactory. Oneplus says it's optic amoled but when compared to the resolution of Samsung S8 the resolution in 6T not looks like that of an optic amoled display.
Completely waste of money if you purchase it just watching the advertisement and specifications... Instead I would suggest to go for Samsung S8+,S8 or pixel 2xl in almost same range.",Rudra,8 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars
Never ever miss out this beast!!,"The main thing I like about this device is it's AMOLED display. It's really cool! And the Oxygen OS! There are no words to describe it's butter smooth UI! It's really awesome.
Battery life is good.Obviously we cannot expect a 2-3 days of battery backup in phones with flagship features. But one full charge is enough and more for day to day use.
Supports dual 4g.
In display finger print scanner is a magic! Yes I know that it is slow when compared to physical fp scanners(difference in milliseconds), but I personally believe that there is nothing to do in phone after unlocking it in this 'milliseconds' time. No one will feel that it is slow.
One plus guarantees regular software updates. I was surprised to see an update for improvised gestures and finger print unlock after setting up the phone for first use! It is worth for its price. On top of that one plus support team is always there for hearing your issues and solving them.",Amazon Customer,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Think twice before you buy mobiles from amazon.,"The product was defective. And amazon kept me on wait for 10 days for no reason to replace the phone,even it was manufacturing defects.",Navy William D'souza,11 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Super Built Great performance,"Using it for a week.Super built, great performance, good camera except night mode and 1 and half day battery life on average use.
Main Pros:
1. Fast performance no lag
2. On-screen finger print
3. Loud bottom speakers
4. Good camera with bokeh/portrait mode in day and low light
5.1 and half day battery life on average use
6. On-screen front flash for selfie mode
Main cons:
1. Finger print unlock not so quick
2. Back camera with night mode is taking several seconds to finalize snap.
3. Not able to use wired head/earphone during charging
4. Require 3rd party video player to play movie
5. No LED notification for full charge, message or miss call.",Amazon Customer,12 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Best product at the price point,"The phone is really good,I bought this phone for gaming and i was satisfied with its performance camera quality is good but not great but i dont care because i am not photographer battery is mind blowing and i love the dash charger display is great easily visible in sun light and the auto brightness works really good the ram management is really great the oxygen os is really a great skin but the in display fingerprint doesnt work well but the face unlock works really good in darkness it uses display as fashlight to unlock",RKD,28 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome phone it is!!!,"Pros:
1.Battery doesn't know when to die..it goes on...such is the battery life!!
2. Low light camera is extraordinary!!
3. Touch screen is super smooth.
4. Reading mode is available which is I think a very good idea from OnePlus!!
5. Navigation gestures are improved.
6. Super fast, flagship processors!!
Cons:
1. Face unlock isn't the best. Doesn't work quite well in low light..but when it works it's very fast!!
2. The in display fingerprint scanner is also very fast but not that much reliable like that ultrasonic sensor present in the OnePlus 6. Sometimes you have to position the finger properly to unlock.
But I am sure that OnePlus is working on it and it will be improved in the coming updates.
Overall: fantastic phone...worth of money...go for it!! You will not regret!!",umasankar,10 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Buy at your own risk....!!,Buy at your own risk..it can't even survive one single drop on the floor...and the back panel will cost you 2k rupees ..God knows how much if screen damage.,Md Salauddin,8 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars
An Upgrade worth it!,"Early days into using the phone, but have loved every bit of the experience till now. First and foremost it is surprisingly easy to use, I mean it adjust very easily into the grip even after it's relatively big size. The curved back makes it easy to use and manoeuvre . The camera is pretty good and does well in all of it's mode but yes still some distance away from the quality of Pixel cameras. The battery life is great and last for almost 24-30 hours per charge. The oxygen OS is almost stock like and gives a very uncluttered experience. The performance of the phone has been top notch - switching between apps is smooth, performance during games, watching youtube videos etc has been fluent and top notch. The in-display fingerprint works almost perfectly. It's fast but at times is unable to recognize. That is probably the only complaint with the device. Good Job One Plus. :)",Aniket Banerjee,5 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Flagship killer & value for money,"First of all I would like to share the seller feedback, the delivery was awful by Amazon.
But it was overruled by Oneplus, means oh my god, what a phone, awesome phone , nicely packed.
Display 5 *
Camera 5 *
Battery 5 *
Value 5 *
Interface 5 *
Overall 5 *
Most important part is migration of data from old to new, thanks to oneplus switch app, oh it's too cool.
My overall experience with first Oneplus is seems so good.
Need some improvement , for e.g. music player and video player is missing.
Let me use for few more months and then again revised or repost the review.",Manish Bhavsar,6 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Best budget smartphone with the best specifications & the best performance & speed till now,"Built quality is very nice , premium feel , but little slippery with the mirror black back.. Always safe side to use with case.. The transparent case that one plus is providing in the box is good..
Camera is really great. Both rear & front... Selfie potrait is really great...
Device performance is something very unique in one plus 6t. I think this is the fastest one till now...
Battery backup up is really good. It easily lasts for one & half day with moderate usage..
Face unlock is simply too fast..
Under display fingerprint is also very good.
The tear drop notch really attractive..
Overall it is the best budget smartphone to buy for 128gb..",chandi prasad,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Good performance at a premium price,"Awesome product and it's performance. There was no lag while playing any high graphic game. No heating issues at all till date with continued use of handset for watching movies, playing games or music for long hours.
Battery is also a killer performer. Easy one full day backup with heavy to super heavy useage. For only calls and limited usage battery lasts a good 1.5 days.
There are some drawbacks as any other product. The 6T has one strange problem, whenever the WiFi hotspot is switched On with Bluetooth headset connected in parallel, there is very severe interference of signals and Bluetooth audio gets disrupted. any update available to fix this?
Also the handset isn't suitable for single handed use.
Overall, 4.5 stars for this handset Shud be good.",Shrivardhan K.,12 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

6gb and 128gb - Not Bad,"I was used Samsung , iPhone 6 &6s, redmi phones... Now one plus.. belows obesrvations from one week...
1. Camera quality not up to the mark..
2. Finger print sometimes not working...
3. Hanged one time..
4. Mobile more weight compared with Samsung
5. Slow motion video not good...
6. Night scape mode... Nothing special
7. Flash not good..
1.Face detection good
2. Battery life awesome
3. Speed - of course 6gb ram... It should be..
4. Notch - special attraction compared with other mobiles.
5. Video quality just okay
6. Full screen and looking good",Narayana Rao,10 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Overhype not meeting expectations,OLED whites are washed in low light. Earpiece is a bad design and needs proper ear alligning to hear the sound while on call. The bezeless edges creates accidental touch and phone operations and needs some smart edge touch prevention algorithms. The camera is not that great as hyped. The finger print touch is unreliable. Overall it's not a value for money. Should have been priced at around 25k₹ and addressing above issues.,Akash,13 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome phone with good battery life and speed.. Really feel like unlock the speed,"It's being more then 20 days since I purchased this phone, Awesome phone with superb speed, battery life is also good after continue usage it work for around 15-20hours still it is more then 30% face unlock is little bit more fast then finger print unlock. Haven't faced any kind of issue as of now but sometime there is call issue using jio sim but don't know is it sim issue or phone issue.

First time user of one plus,"Excited to purchase with exchange which was smooth. No complains on that front. On using the phone for the last 12 hours, really fast and smooth with very fast processor and no lag even on multi tasking. No heating issues as such so far. Only thing that I felt could have been better was weight of the phone, which is slightly on the higher side. Will update later",Samreen,5 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Happiest purchase,"I order my new OnePlus 6t device on 1st November and it shipped fast and deliver fast in an excellent packing by Amazon , I just unboxed , I am being studying with my phone for nearly 10days then I realized that
This phone is awesome that i can ever imagine in my life , interms of looks : it's looks stunning , (build ,speed, performance like a ""bull""), price is little high in my opinion , battery is excellent compared to OnePlus 6 , in terms of camera the rear or back camera is outstanding but front camera is not that great, so guy's if you are looking for a selfie centric phone then don't choose this , else just close the eyes and buy it , finally the indisplay finger print sensor works perfectly 98 times and better than any indisplay finger print sensor in the world ,

Phone speed is also best.. The phone looks classy.. not bigger or smaller in size..

Excellent product ... Battery life sucks,"Awesome phone with all the features... Camera is best in the class both front and rear. Performance is best compared to one plus 6. The only issue I have is a battery life. Though one plus has increased the battery capacity to 3700 may.. it lasts macimum 6-7 hours of average usage.. if u play games continuously for 4 hours the battery is almost dead. One plus this is not really expected from u guys. The only good things here is when put for charging it charges 100% in abt 45-50 min.
Type c to 3.5 mm convertor works fine. The original sound quality is maintained. Overall a perfect buy.",tejaskathane,14 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Goes loud and long.!,"Okay I'd like to talk about a few things that nobody else is saying. The battery life is excellent for a flagship phone, about 8 hours of SOT which is more than excellent, also the speaker, though single is loud enough for the noisiest of environments. And the people who think that the new fingerprint scanner is too slow, I received a software update as soon I activated the phone, and after I updated the software, fingerprint scanning was a lot snappier.
Overall, great phone in the price range.",Ankit,5 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Ofcourse at the end it will hang little longer but not as expected. Display Hangs!! Yes!!! this phone hangs even with 8gb RAM, have faced it few times even in first 10 days. Worst part is the front screen lock is too too slow, even i have to use pin code most of the time.

Absolutely the best!,"6t is rightfully the flagship killer and the best phone in the market today. It has the looks, the hardware and the latest software. Enough pros but it has to have some cons. While it's lesser priced for the specs it contains, 38 grand is still a heavy amount. The camera is great but not the best in the market. Need more color variants in India. The fast charging is an absolute delight.",Vijay Senthil,25 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Warning: It's a flagship Killer😍,"I love this phone so much.. Received it yesterday.. Delivery was great.. n I had to exchange my old S6 with this beauty got 4k off.. which I loved.. Thanks Amazon so much..
❤️Loved The new tear drop Notch
❤️ Speed is great
❤️ Battery works for hours.. Screen on time is around 7 hours
❤️Alert slider is good too
❤️Camera Quality is So Clear n perfect.. I don't need a DSLR no more..
❤️ It's big because of it's huge battery so keeps on sliding off my hands but You're getting a cover in box so no worries😍😍 and lacks Audio Jack which is a drawback but Now It's common in all phones so can't complain😂
❤️Wish they provided it with C type earphones but it was not in box
🤩Overall It's a great Deal Go for it..",zainab,20 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome phone to go with!,"Everything is good! Initially there was a delay while accessing in-display fingerprint. Post update that is also sorted. Cam is super clear!
With 100% usage the backup is up-to 16-18 hours. Oneplus 6 users may not love it as there is no much difference comparatively!
Pre-booking offer should have been wireless rather than a wired headset.",Ali,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

A good phone from OnePlus! But ....,"First thing first there is nothing wrong with one plus 6t.The screen is amoled which has good viewing angles.Colours are vibrant and screen brightness is also good.Camera is great but could have been better. Sound quality is good but lack of dual speakers still hurts.Battery backup is improved courtesy the 3700 mAh battery. Snapdragon 845 with oxygen os is an experience of its kind.
Though I have used one plus since their flagship killer one plus one, a customer centric and community driven company is losing its own tagline of Never Settle by trying to settle down with no headphone jack,a camera hardware which remains same since one plus 5,no IP certification,no wireless charging.Above all the all the inflating costs of OnePlus phones when a smartphone with the same processor is being sold at half the price. I hope to see better innovative and original ideas from the OnePlus team in future as still I believe they can do it!",asir,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
A Terrific Job OnePlus,"I'm reviewing after about a week of usage. I donno about the previous OnePlus models, I just entered the OnePlus community with the 8 GB +128 GB Version
As far as the mobile goes it's a beast, I'm totally satisfied with the performance of the product
Pros
1. Awesome Processor - Snapdragon 845 at its best, combined with the 8 GB RAM, you experience 0 lag on a perfect WiFi connection
2. Good Daylight Camera, 4K video with 60 fps frame rate felt dang awesome
3. Big Cheers for the near complete Display, OPTIC AMOLED gives a great viewing experience
4. Speakers are loud but having Stereo speakers would have done great to this mobile
5. DASH Charge works great! Speed is what you need
6. The USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone jack cable is sturdy, I was worried that the earphones piece may fall off but nodes within the jack space save the drop and hold it in place
7. Good Delivery and the Packaging, fell in love with OnePlus
8. InDisplay Fingerprint scanner is awesome. It takes less than half a second to do the job
9. Face unlock is super fast
10. Near Stock Android UI is great..! Oxygen OS simply does a terrific job
11. Teardrop notch is awesome, although I covered the notch area for my notification bar and the blacked out notification bar is great
12. Adding a USB C Hub expands it's functionality, combining with the 6.4 inch screen almost gives a PC like experience
Cons
1. Battery life doesn't seem that great although I'm a kinda heavy user
2. Night camera is bad, My RX 100 mk2 does a great job when compared to this
3. Camera zoom is terrible, I hate that part of the Smartphone camera. Again My RX 100 mk 2 does a great job
4. Implementation of the fingerprint on the power button would have been good, take a note OnePlus
5. Adding a display that supports 4K would have been a great thing, of miss 4K videos on YouTube
6. Next time release Gaming phones with add-ons like 120 fps display, 4k display and a gaming chip
Overall it's a beast
I gave my honest opinion",MadooriC Prime,12 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Two days usage of Oneplus 6t,"Well just received it one day back.
Experience is smooth. Software update is very frequently. Got two update since now.
On screen fingerprint scanner improved from last update i guess.
Camera is super good, but need more software update for portrait mode and nigh mode. Its looks like they changed the name of hdr mode to night mode. Nigh mode is useless.
Face unlock is really good. Sound is also really good, didn't test the earphone. For normal users the battery will last almost 36hrs with dual 4g on. Dash charger is charging it really quickly. Still testing.",Subrata Debanth,7 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Fast charging enable very short duration of charging and long lasting medium use lasts for a day mild use may last for couple of days
Overall it's very nice product compared to pixel n Samsung note 9 n Apple
Though it doesn't have water n dust resistance n wireless charging it's still best mobile phone that OnePlus has produced

Honest opinions after 20 days of usage.,"One of the best investments I have made so far.
Let's start with the Pros first:-
1) Build Quality:- For 38k the built quality is amazing. You get that premium feel as soon as you hold the phone in your hands.
2) Screen Quality:- The screen quality is good. Better than the IPS LCD displays used on Asus Zenfone 5z. Colours are very punchy and the display is very crisp.
3) Battery Life:- This is the biggest pro of this device. The 3700mah battery lasts easily for one and a half to 2 days on heavy usage. It can easily last for 3 days on medium usage. The best part is that we have the amazing OnePlus Dash charger. It takes 1hr 28mins to charge from 0 to 100%.
4) Oxygen OS:- The Best thing about OnePlus is their fast and fluid UI. It's very close to stock Android which makes the device very snappy. You do not notice any lagg whatsoever.
5) In-display Fingerprint:-The USP of OnePlus 6T. Trust me the the fingerprint is very very fast. You can't compare it with that Vivo device which first came with this technology.
Now the Cons:-
1)No headphone jack:- Not a deal breaker but it might be annoying for people who use wired headphones.
2)No Stereo speakers:- The sound output from the speaker is loud enough but considering the price of this device they should have provided stereo speakers.
3)No LED Notification Light:- I don't understand why they removed it. You have to rely on the ambient display always.
4) Not so good RAM Management:- I think this is a software bug. I have noticed this several times. Apps like YouTube & Instagram does not stay in memory and reloads. This is quite annoying. Hope they fix this with a software update.
5) No Wireless Charging:- They call it ""Flagship killer"" but there's no wireless charging.
6)No IP Protection:- It's the 8th ""FLAGSHIP KILLER"" device from OnePlus but still no IP rating.
Final Verdict:-
If you already have OnePlus 6 or even the 5T, there's no point of upgrading to 6T. Instead you can wait for next 6 months and get your hands on the OnePlus 7. The OnePlus 7 will come with Snapdragon 855 which will have support for 5G. Also we will see improvements in the camera and it might even come with Stereo speakers and an IP rating.
But if you are currently on an old laggy phone with poor UI, battery life, and looking for a premium device but don't want to spend more than 40k, the OnePlus 6T will prove as a very good upgrade.",Shashwat Sharma,26 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
NEVER SETTLE? NOT THIS TIME. [MOST DETAILED REVIEW],"The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-
This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.
CONS (Ranked) -
1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.
2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.
3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.
4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.
5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.
P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.
PROS (Ranked) -
1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.
2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.
3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.
4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.
5. Great screen.
6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.
7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.
P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..
All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.
4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY",Abhishek Chakravorty,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a Beast with a cute notch!,"A Perfect Value for money phone.
128GB ROM and 8GB RAM and a Superfast OS and a Butter smooth User Interface!
What more do you want? Amazon delivered it in 2days to me. I am super happy with this device!
The phone gives you a premium feel when you hold it. I was an apple fan. But Oneplus rules my heart now.
3.5mm Headphone Jack missing but they have also provided the Dongle along. You can't really complain because instead, now they have increased the battery.",Dibyodak Mitra,14 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Oneplus 6t Review: Trust me 😉,"Picture quality is not up to the mark (7/10)
But one of the best quality mobile is it's performance.
Finger print sensor need some more updates.
I just seen few of the reviews below that ppl are complaining about the display, but I totally disagree with those folks. I'm very much attracted for one plus 6t bcoz of it's AMOLED display more than the onscreen fingerprint. Trust me display quality is flawless.
Overall, worth buying it.",Sanjeev,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

"The one who says Never Settle,Can make you settle with this phone.Go for OnePlus","One of the best Android phone in market,if you want to get a premium phone with all necessary requirements,you should go for OnePlus 6T.First time I bought a phone worth 38k and the money worth it. The phone look is so aesthetic, completely wow and the water drop notch,may be you can find that in Vivo or Oppo as well,but I can tell you,you will find this better,a compact look.Joining the OnePlus Community is one of the best decision you can take,and I believe from Next OnePlus Flagships,the price will go higher,so unlock the speed and experience the best now.
Things that I loved about it-
Phone Performance
Phone look-Sleek and Handy
Dash charge
Storage
A great Display
Watching HD videos is a privilege in it
Portrait mode rear and front both
Good packaging
Alert slider
Video Quality
Things that can be improvised-
Night mode camera optimization,it is making the picture litte whitish.
Selfie in low light and front flash.
Indisplay firgerprint sensor is little slow.
No sensor light in front,hard to find whether it's charging or not.",Sarmistha,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great phone with minor glitches.,"After using it for a Week.
Pros:
1) Phone's battery life is great, lasts more than a day, using it across different Wi-Fi, Mobile networks, Calling, Surfing, Watching videos ... Still the battery holds good.
2). Sound quality is good.
3) Default back case that comes with box is good.
4) Camera quality is good not that great!
Cons:
1) In-Display finger print scanner stops working randomly, I have to lock and unlock the phone again to make it works.
2) The amount of time taken to unlock the phone via Fingerprint scanner lags sometimes but it works well most of the time.
3) Night sight mode needs to be improved. The images taken with low lighting is not that great. Looks Ok Ok.",Amazon Customer,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Product is awesome just one thing, Effects while cliking from camera like in other phones","Product is awesome . camera is jst speechlessly awesome but one thing is lacking behind that is Not having effects while cliking from camera like do have in other one plus phones. Rest all is nice to use , fingerprint is lil less smartly active in compare to Face recognition(its superb). No regrets after buying One plus 6t",sonam thakur,5 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Not a flagship anymore,"Upgraded from 6 to 6t
My one line review - "" I will pick 6 anytime over 6t""
Some Important Points :
On Screen fingerprint sensor is fast but of course not that past as physical fingerprint sensor
Camera there is no change except the so called NIGHTSCAPE and if you are expecting it to be like one in pixel let me tell you that is a complete no
Algorithms of both the phones are different for low light photos and one used in one plus is bit shaggy .
It basically illuminates the light sources present in the photo and spread it evenly over the entire click
Screen is good , notch is better than that old notch
Battery is average , though they have increased the capacity but i dont see major differences in screen on time . Dash charge though is the best thing about one plus
Overall Review : A power packed phone with good build and performance but now doesnt look like a flagship nor even a flagship killer",Sarthak Dhingra,9 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Spectacular. But...,"Been using since 3 days. This mobile is very awesome. But.... The finger print sensor is not as satisfying compared to the normal ones.

KADAK,Great phone. Fastest phone in the world. Also great features looks style display n overall performance,Abhushek S Gaikwad,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Speed wise good but lack of some features which are avilable in low budget products,"After using 15 days these are my observations.
Speed wise it is very good as it have 8GB Ram with Snapdragon processor. Look wise its very nice and design and quality of the material is good. When come to Fingerprint the animations are looking fabulous while unlocking but some times not capturing for 2 or 3 sec then giving no detected message. Need improvement there. Coming to camera need more improvements overall. The one option I am regret is clicking picture only by using the capture button. As my moto g2 have full screen capture option and g4 have fingerprint to click option with screen. But here we don't have any fingerprint option also so sometimes while taking selfies for large group its very difficult to capture using the only button. Same time by using earphones also we are not able to capture images. Need software improvement there.
Coming to calls while taking with earphones we are unable to mute the call by using earphones. Which is there for my all previous phones which are very low budget ones. While taking client calls it is making very uncomfortable because I am used to earphone play/pause button to mute the call.
Coming to network while in call the internet or messages option is not working. Internet usage my be restricted while in call but the messages option need to be improved. Because in some urgent call if some one calls we need message them back saying so.
Overall its good to use but need some really cool improvements software wise.",Ganesh Bandi,20 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Value for money,"This is my second OP after OP5. Amazing phone. Here are some pros and cons-
Pros-
1) Water Drop Notch
2) Screen Unlock
3) Bigger Battery
4) Amazing Camera on both sides
Cons-
1) If you wanna unlock your phone via either Screen Lock or Face Unlock, you have to make screen on,which is annoying sometimes. In this way I like my OP5 because there is FPS and I can unlock my phone just by pressing it. I am sure One Plus will look into this.
2) Nightscape- Although I am very used to Oxygen OS but I cannot fully satisfied with Nightscape mode of camera. It always gives blurry pics but happy with overall performance.
3) No LED Notification- Due to waterdrop notch they sacrifies Notification light, which is very disappointed from my perspective. well I think that if there is no hardware for LED notification then OP team should come with a software update by which a small pixel work just like a notification led.
So here are some pros and cons. Considering these cons I still give 5/5. It's just amazing phone. And if you compere with any other smartphone for eg Pixel 3,then it is far way ahead of those.
A must buy for premium phone lovers, I can bet you'll not get disappoint by this.",Sachin Chaudhary,9 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

-camera is very good
-very fast phone.. no lag
-storage capacity is 128 gig
-given attachment for headphone is good and tight so you can your earphone with attachment and not worry of losing it
-not heating felt when used long time..my Samsung s8 gets very hot
Cons:
-otg is toooooo slow..
-video apps not able to cast to TV. Eg Amazon prime works.on my Samsung and cheap jio phone also
-when cast to TV..left side black band is there is and display does not occupy full screen of TV
-can be fixed with update I feel

The speed you need.,"They are exactly Working on their tag line ""the speed you need"". It's very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can't be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought.",Pratik Jain...,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great phone,"Dislike first:
* No headphone jack (you do getva converter though)
* No card slot
* Slightly slower fingerprint unlocking than hardware
But other than that, super fast and amazing phone
Some additional things i do like:
* In built app cloning (run 2 instances of same app)
* In built app lock (however it uses same password as screen lock)",Amazon Customer,28 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Perfect phone to buy.,"After using this phone I am so happy and thankful to one plus for giving this type of phone in market. Face unlocking is perfect.......

Low light camera is superb........

Good phone,"I like the phone very much. Messages option is very nice. Sending all notifications under one category. But it would be better you should have provided FM(Radio) default app also. Also all the pics if displayed at one place will be easier. Now we have to go to collections and search if we require any pic that was sent from friends.
I didn't understand how the second camera works. If there is no option of changing camera, what is the use of giving 2 cameras backside?",NAVEEN,4 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Phone pictures are warm, camera focus isn't that great. Don't understand what the fuss is all about this phone. spend few thousands more and get the real premium phone S8+/s9+ you will love it.

1. BATTERY LIFE OSM
2. SENSORS OF FINGERPRINT & FACELOCK UPTO GOOD AT SOME EXTEND.

WHATS BAD :
1. PICTURED TAKEN DIECTLY FROM WHATSAPP CAMERA IS BLUR.
2. SCREENSHOTS SHARED ON OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE INSTA IS BLUR.
3.ONLY ONE SPEAKER IS WORKING.
4.U HAVE PRESS HARD FOR FINGERPRINT TO UNLOCK , UNLESS IT WAS FASTER TO UNLOCK IF IT WAS AT BACK SIDE OF PHONE WHICH IS UNDER ONE PLUS 6.

The smartphone you should buy !!,"I have been using this phone since 3rd Nov, so after using it extensively for about half a month, here is what i think.
• Performance : Overall performance is mind blowing.
•Battery+Dash Charge : Battery life is just amazing and bundle it with the dash charging, u will never ever run out of power. (It makes up for no wireless charging and frankly it didnt even bother me)
•Camera : Camera quality is superb, use it with pixels camera port and it can challenge any smartphone anyday. I have added one photo which i shot in very low light using night mode, u can check it.
•Sound : Sound is also great (i have heard so many people complaining about absence of stereo speakers but i didn't notice much of a difference, it has performed upto the mark in every situation uptil now like in very noisy backgrounds)
•Screen-Body Ratio : The bezels are so thin that u will fall in love with this phone if u watch videos and movies extensively on phones.
•Display : The display is also very crsip and clear being fullhd+ display (i didn't notice much difference from quadhd displays)
•Security : Face unlock is lightning fast and u will not even see the lock screen most of the times during unlocking.
•In-display fingerprint scanner is also good not perfect as it sometimes dont recognise the finger but thats ok because with time u will get used to placing ur fingers in the required manner.
•Build quality : It is very very Premium and , u will feel really good while holding them in ur hands. Its design is very sleek and curvy edges makes them easy to hold.
•Dual sim card, so that's another good thing.
•Tiny Notch : I dont like notches but in todays world of notches its the best u can get, its very less intrusive and its so small that i dont even notice it now.
•OxygenOs : its one of the reasons why i love one plus devices. The customisations available are just awesome. U can set up your phone the way u like it with pure stock android experience. Its just an icing on the cake.
•Android Updates : its another thing which u will enjoy owning this device. Most of the companies dont provide that. (This is applicable to all one plus devices though)
•Storage : Base storage is 128 gigs, thats huge.
The only drawback i find is absence of headphone jack which is not a deao breaker according to me as there are other alternatives to it, so u can easily move on to Bluetooth or type c headphones. Just like the time when touch screen phones were launched in the world of keypad phones. People were sceptical back then also.
Notable mention : No IP rating is just a myth. Its totally water and dust resistant, i have seen a lot of videos on you tube confirming that. They just didn't want to increase the price to another 20-30$ in order to get that certification as they are very costly.
My opinion : Just go for it if you dont own one plus 6 or to some extent one plus 5t. Rest if u are looking for an upgrade, this is the one u should get.
I hope i cleared ur doubts. Thanks.",Abhishek Baghel,22 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Almost PERFECT mobile.....ALMOST,"Bought mobile minutes after launch, using till date, really impressed with this one. Works like a charm. everyone talks positive content, let me point out few negatives i experienced in this (Not applicable to everyone i guess)....
1)The in-display finger print display sometimes takes more time than it has to. so it can be said that a dedicated Finger Print sensor is better than this. Not that in display finger Print sensor is bad, but sometimes not very responsive. and i hate when at night time when i try to unlock and a WHITE BRIGHT SCREEN comes upon to detect my face for face-Unlock (Which can be disabled).
2) The Camera quality is not that great AS EXPECTED, but its really good, but i expected a little more clarity.
These two are the only Negative points i see. Rest of it, its a wonderful mobile and i'm having a lot of fun using it. i'd say BUY IT, coz there's no way you can get all the features available in this mobile for such a low price while in these days a mobile with high specs comes for a minimum of Rs 60,000. GO FOR IT.
NOTE TO ONEPLUS :- Bro, take some time and come up with better looking and thinner bumper cases. Come on dude, we spending for you. My GODDD HUMAN. -_-

Honest review so far from 1st time OnePlus buyer,"I will keep it very simple.
Display - Though 1080p , beautiful display. No doubt can't compare with samsu g note 9's dsiplay but still price point comparison justified.
Sound Output- nothing much special. Good quality not excellent as LG G6
Performance- superb. Nothing can beat this. Everything seems so smooth.
OS- I like oxygen os. No blotware and no nonsense application. Just giving you what you want. Very good customization options and rich in terms of settings.
Camera- I didn't get any opportunities to capture in different condition but whatever I have used I liked all photos and videos.
Battery : stunning battery backup. I usually get 6.5 hours of screen on time. If you don't play games and moderate use, 1.5+ days of battery backup.
Some things you will miss in OP6T.
1) headphone jack for sure bcz I was using previously headphone jack mobile and now I don't have headphone jack so I really miss that.
2) Type c bullet headset is not good enough. Not worth of 1500 INR.
3) after gaming of 1.5+ hours, phone gets little warm and I can feel that even if I use case. But no drops in fps of games so that didn't bother me.",Akash M.,18 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Picture is just good. Reading mode is really useful for bookworms. Much like kindle readability.

Experience of my first ever OnePlus device. (Sweet + Sour),"Hello everyone,
OnePlus (Sounds great)
As I am using this phone around 15 days. Sharing my experience with this device.
One of the toughest decision made to buying this phone. Pre booked OnePlus 6T & Placed my first ever OnePlus device on 3rd of November. Using it only 4 days found a hardware issue in receiver and repaced the item.
Got my new one replaced item on 11th of November. Now after using it around 10 days again facing issues now with camera and noticed display flickering too.
Maybe this issue is happening in my device only or with some people's too facing this issue.
As of now again making a toughest decision to Return this phone as apart from this issues which is slightly a Major problem this phone is awesome 👌👌👌
Taking about touch, processer, finger print scanner, display quality every single thing is Loveable.

Review,"So this is my first time writing a review about anything , normally i read and watch reviews given by other people but this phone is getting a lot of criticism .
The reason might be the design the not change in hardware and other things.But people don't realize that this phone was not made for the people who owned the one plus 6 ,it was for the people who were upgrading form a one plus 3 or 3t or 5 .
Me being a user of one plus 3t absolutely love one plus foe their software and hardware
when they had launched the one plus 3t it was not a major upgrade over the 3 but a phone for the people who were looking to move into the one plus ecosystem ,it had the same design and almost the same specs (sanpdragon 821).
Now coming back to the main topic the review
the design is a minor upgrade over the last model
as the notch is smaller and there is no headphone jack (the hardest of choices require the strongest of wills)
i don't mind the removal of headphone jack as i really wanted to buy the one plus wireless bullets but they are still not available and I had to buy the type c bullets instead of them.
The hardware is good but could have been better i.e in the camera they could have given a secondary wide angel lense .
the haptic feedback could be better .
Now the software we all now that oxygen os is one of the greatest crearion of one plus as it is optimized and snappy at the same time but there the are few things that i would like inculded in the software like manual video mode and a refresh ti the text message app.
Now there are some things that i love to the use of Android pi , the inscereen finegeprint , night mode .
There are also a few tiny deatils lik if you chek incoming vibration pattern they have new names for every pattern .
This one plus always holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely love this phone and i would recommend this if you're looking for an update
( but not an update over the 6 )",Siddhanth,23 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Bang for yout buck! *A 15 days usage - In depth review!*,"This phone sure has grabbed a lot of attention be it for the amazing performance of the phone or for the in display finger print scanner being a little slower than that of the physical scanner.
Camera sure is the finest of the cameras you're getting in a phone worth INR 40,000. The speaker grill on the bottom sure should have been stereo but now when they've given it a mono speaker, I must say the sound quality isn't that poor for it to be a deal breaker.
Headphone jack has been taken off could be a deal breaker for a few of you but once you start to use the phone with the extended battery life, you'll appreciate the company to have taken this step of removing the headphone jack. For you can opt for a permanent solution of a Bluetooth earphone but you cannot really carry a power bank everywhere you go.
The design is the thing that matters to the most of you but in my case it's the least that matters so I'll talk about it in the end. For now let's get to the performance, Switching from already a very fast OnePlus 3 to the even faster OnePlus 6T was the best thing that has happened to me in the past few days. I wasn't sure, I'd feel a significantly higher performance from this phone compared to my last phone but when I used it, it sure surprised me. I haven't felt transitions on Android better than this. So unless you can afford a 75-80,000 Rs. Pixel 3 XL, Go get yourself a OnePlus 6T.
Oww .. Now that you know I am a fan of Pixel 3, you must have also known that looks did not matter to me, the weird notch of pixel 3 and the huge chin did not affect me as much as I look for a better performing phone but wait.. I could have gotten myself a pixel 3 XL but OnePlus 6T with it's amazing amazing build quality and looks took my heart awayyy and I ended up buying it. 🍻

OnePlus 6T : Battery Beast !,"Build Quality : 10/10
Camera: 8/10 (Though, I believe this will change with software updates in the future)
Sound/9/10
Performance: 10/10
Should You buy this over Poco f1?
Ans: Yes, If you want better service guarantee and a well-built phone + Under Display FP Scanner.
CAMERA:
The camera is pretty decent for the price. The hardware setup which they are using is top tier but the only place where the camera falls short is the poor algorithm for Night Mode. Rest assured, XDA devs will probably push a Gcam later this month which will most probably pull the camera department upto a Solid 9 if not 10. Will update once that happens !
BATTERY:
This phone has the best battery backup I've seen in the industry. I am getting around 7.5/8 hours of SOT and the phone only takes about 45-50 minutes to fully charge. This was mindblowing for me.",TAM,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Top camera in duel camera, it's just only for portrait mode.. you can cover it for all other modes no problem. Even though this phone gives you depth photos...

It's Perfect,"I just switched from my iPhone SE to OnePlus 6T so it was a major upgrade for me. First of all, the Amazon here did a great job with the packing and delivery. The OnePlus box packing is awesome. I even liked it before opening. Coming to the phone, it has all the best features with best working quality one can expect. The Face unlock is super fast, like it's gets unlocked even before you realize. Finger print scanner is very good and it got better after Oxygen OS 9.05 update! The gaming is awesome, I played PUBG and it's very smooth and cool on this phone. The sound quality and picture quality are as expected. Need to mention the Nightscape mode especially, it gives a great picture as if it's very clear even in the pitch dark!! Oh God! The battery! The battery life is the coolest thing in here! I only charge once in a day to 100% and that's all. With continuous use of the social apps like FB, WhatsApp and Instagram and gaming for 3-4 hours the battery isn't under 15% after 13-14 hours 😍😍 Even though I hated the large screen phones(one of the reasons I bought iPhone SE) this one looks different though! With the screen resolution and different modes and themes the phone is just beautiful! It's a lot better option when compared to highend flagship phones which are over priced!",John spurgeon,10 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Phone of dreams - Yes 6T it is !! proud to be,"The OnePlus 6T could be a really nice phone notwithstanding what the value, however at half the price of AN iPhone XS with a newest in show fingerprint sensing element this can be the cut-price get of the year. everyone is complaining regarding in-display fingerprint scanner is slow however trust American state its terribly in no time, the phone gets unbolted as shortly as your finger touches the screen and a lot of correct than alternative phones, this can be the smartphone that brings all-screen style up a notch. The OnePlus 6T proves that the newest technology doesn’t need to value the world, delivery AN in-display fingerprint scanner and a small notch for simply 37K. The attractive, crisp and vibrant OLED show could be a whit larger at half dozen.41in, with a smaller chin at very cheap is just wonderful, coming back to the camera the new nightscape low lightweight mode will an honest job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is additionally pretty sensible Portrait mode works as publicized, Overall the camera on the OnePlus 6T is nice and once you use the fingerprint sensing element the night mode for the show is disabled quickly and so fades back in once you’ve unbolted the phone. The phone comes with a screen guardian already thereon. the one bottom-firing speaker is loud and includes a comparatively great amount of bass for the phone, however, is definitely blocked whereas enjoying a game. OnePlus’s alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and continues to be good. OnePlus phones have continually been sensible for the money, providing prime specifications in well-built devices, however not pushing the boundaries of what’s doable. That’s modified for the OnePlus 6T. it's pushing what’s doable with the favored all-screen style employing a small, enticing teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it’s a more robust phone for it. however it's the introduction of a newest in-display fingerprint scanner, ANd creating it works rather well for as very little as [*fr1] the value of an iPhone XS, that's most spectacular. there’s no wireless charging, it doesn’t have any of the flowery 3D face systems of some and it's a bit plain, however, everything else is a prime notch. Even the software package expertise is superb.
Pros:- sensible battery life, nice screen, wonderful performance, dual-sim, sensible camera, Bluetooth five, nice software package, tiny notch, in-screen fingerprint sensing element, alert slider, super-fast charging battery, cheap worth relative to premium phones, last however not least Blazing quick software package
Cons:- No notification lightweight, glass back, however, no wireless charging, no expandable storage.

✌️❤️,"I'm writing this after a complete one day use. First of all mobile looks very premium in hands. AMOLED display with notch is quite awesome. Sound output quality and call quality is good. Battery life for minimal users will be 1 and Half to 2 days. For users who browse and play games will be one day. 0-70% quick charge will happen in first 30-35 minutes and overall it takes 55mins to an hour time for full battery. An immediate security patch for better enhancements will be available. Camera quality is good pictures are coming out like awesome in all the modes. Upgraded from OnePlus 3 after two years of usage to 6t. Bought mobile for 25744 after exchange and other discounts. Phone is good at speed. Ram optimization is nice. Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box. One thing which I have noticed is the download speed from Jio SIM is bit slow for first 3 to 5 hours. After that don't know it picked up really well. Go for this phone when you need all the features at a minimum cost with premium feel.
Will let you know more after usage.",Amazon Customer,5 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome product,"One plus 6T is arrived and used for 1 week. One plus 6T is good phone with good design, camera quality, functioning and the battery storage. This product has won my heart. There is some complain from my side,
This phone has on screen fingerprint sensor which works a but slow and also the night mode feature do not capture good images as compared to google pixels. This phone has a long battery life but because of this phone weights a bit high as compared to one plus 6. I will rate 9.5 instead of 10 just because i expected night mode and on screen fingerprint to be the best one.",DIPESH KATKAR,11 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
The Real Beast,"It Was My Dream To Buy A OnePlus phone.Last Week,It Became Success.
First Of All
1.It Has a Good(Luxurious) design .
2.Screen Finger Print And Face Unlock is Impressive
3.The battery life is Superbb which Stays minimum 1 day (when we use full time)
4.Camera Is much better than any phone Which There Is Pro mode.Everyone Says Google Pixel Has Better Camera,But One Plus Has Great Camera That Competes Google.
5.In My opinion Mirror Black is Perfect For Youth As They are Concentrated In Style.
6.Also The Main Thing Is It's Speed,One Plus Knew It Before,So They Named It As ""Unlock The Speed"".6 GB Ram Is Enough For a normal user.
Those Who Have Less Budget Can Go For MI phones or Anything else. Those Who Budget More Than 35000 Can Surely Go This Beast Phone. U Will Not Become Disappointed, That's For Sure....",Harish Kamath,16 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
A Technological Masterpiece!!,"I'm pretty sure you guys have read almost every tech review about this by now so I won't waste your time with all those. When it comes to real life performance, it pretty much is the best out there.
Charging is super fast and the battery runs for about more than 2 days with considerable usage.
Software just couldn't get better.
Sound quality is loud and clear and probably the best you could get at this price.
Performance will not be an issue at all.
I'm a person who invests in a beastly device for long term usage (My last phone is still working in prime condition after over 5 years of usage!) and I can go out on a limb and say this is one device which is gonna last really long.
The cameras are just exquisite!!
The build quality is just awesome and pretty sturdy. Additionally you do get a protective case to get you started which is really solid too.
To sum it all up, if you're looking for a phone which can literally make people drool whilst not burning a hole in your pocket this is your way to go!!",Yogesh Vyas,15 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Best phone around the 40k mark!,"Spent a few days with the phone now and I like it so far. The screen is awesome and the notch is not that bad. The phone feels fast and responsive and oxygen os is pretty good in my opinion. The camera is decent although I would have loved a different secondary lens like a wide angle one. Battery lasts me a full day easily and still has 30% charge remaining by the end. There are a few minor compromises but they dont matter to me personally so I have nothing to complain but i'll still list them out. They say its water resistant but it has no IP certification so I don't know exactly how water resistant it is. No headphone jack but I already used bluetooth headphones even when my phone had a headphone jack so not missing it at all. No wireless charging but I dont use that either so doesn't matter to me. Lastly to me the phone is a looker, I love its looks and seamless design.
So at the end for me personally I am getting everything I wanted out of a phone for 20k less than flagship prices so I am happy.",Ayush Sharma,4 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
One of the best phones out there!,"I was finally able to convince my father to buy the Oneplus 6T instead of the iPhone 8, X, XS, and XR. It is way cheaper than most iPhones and better. I mean look at the XR. It has a 'liquid retina' display. LUL. It stills says an 'LCD' display on the website. It has a single camera instead of 2 like the X or XS. The screen is better, the phone is faster (not sure if it is faster than iPhones I mean their Bionic chips are really fast), and the battery is good plus it has dash charging which has its side effects to the battery. Plus the screen to body ratio is awesome! With the onscreen fingerprint. Which is slower because of the technology behind it. All in all it is the best Premium Smartphone in the Indian Market.",Bhavya,16 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
A premium phone for a steal,"Being a tech savvy person, I have owned a Galaxy S3, iPhone 6 and was using a Galaxy S8 until I replaced it with a OnePlus 6T. It was my first experience of trying a smartphone out of my comfort zone (a samsung or an apple).
OnePlus 6T has met all my standards
• Premium phone (both look and feel) at the best price
• Screen resolution is good
• The battery life is amazing. To be exact, I watched Brooklyn 99 for an entire day (10 hours) on the Netflix app
• The processing speed is mind blowing. 0 lag
• Camera both front and rear are super amazing with potrait modes. Night feature for night photography takes time to process but I'll say the picture is worth the wait
Nothing can be perfect, some negatives
• On screen fingerprint takes time to open and struggles to work with dirt on the screen or a fat tempered glass
• Night feature takes a lot of time to process the photo
• No health app to monitor the steps. In-built pedometer is something I look for in a smartphone
• Phone is heavy but battery life compensates the struggle
I am really happy with the phone and would suggest most of you to buy it. It'll be foolish right now (November, 2018) and spend that kind of money to buy an apple, a samsung or a pixel unless you are a die hard fan of those smartphone. I respect your opinion.",Naren Bhatia,20 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Honest review 13day usage!,"Well my younger brother and I order 2 new phones on the same day ,ie:01Nov18 to see who have made a right choice! I oped to 1+6t &my brother got Vivo v11Pro. (I regret my choice) Camera:Both phones have a great Camera but vivo has that white'sh shade in photo that we usually see on oppo&vivo but I don't think that is a valid reason to say it's not as 1+.Build quality:1+ comes with glass back and looks much premium but Vivo's duel shade back is no looser tho.FaceUnlock Speed:I might sound wierd but I think Face unlock speed on vivo is twice as on 1+ and the phone never misses. Graphics:Both phone are euqal no one looses here. Battery: Without a single doubt in my mind I can say V11 is the winner here.(on a 100%charge on both phones we started playing PUBG on high graphics and full volume my 1+ was switched off after 6 round of games but V11 had 20% of juice left in it) and finally Price: I really really regret buying 6t instead of V11pro which has all the similar feature for almost half of the prize. I would recommend Vivo v11 pro any time to anyone.",Altaf,4 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars
The Beast & Flagship Killer,"I moved from iPhone 7 Plus to this phone and my experience with this is completely awesome.
Pros:
It is lightweight, display is magnificent, OxygenOS is far more better than iOS, the in display fingerprint scanner is like a future tech and works pretty fast (faster than Touch ID), Face Unlock works within milliseconds, the gestures are amazing, gameplay with PUBG & Ashphalt 9 is smooth as butter, battery backup is hell good. It is a must buy phone!
Cons:
As I moved from iPhone, I would say it's camera quality is not upto the mark, Portrait images simply cannot be compared to like those of iPhone 7 Plus and above.
I am being brutally honest and I hope my review helps.",Amazon Customer,19 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

My few hours experience with OnePlus 6T - 8GB RAM - 256 GB Storage Mobile,"Yesterday, I bought Oneplus 6T - 8GB RAM - 256 GB Storage, Mobile.
1. I ordered for this phone on 02 November 2018 and as assured, Amazon delivered it yesterday. Thanks to Amazon.
I have started using it. So far, so good.
2. When I charge this Mobile, the Charging Light is not glowing.
Is there a Charging Light in this Mobile?
OnePlus company says 'No Charging Light' in this mobile.
Thumbs Down not to have this basic feature in this model.
3. The printed Quick Start Guide which came with this mobile is in Red Colour Paper with Black Colour tiny font, making it too difficult to read during night even with good tubelight.
4. This mobile is available only in two black colour variants. They should at least make it available in White colour also.
5. The weight of the Charging plug is more. I feel it may be around 175 grams.

The best phone on earth right now. Period!,"I've seen people cribbing about how 6T is not worth upgrading to. Well, What they don't say is, it's not worth upgrading if you own a Oneplus 6. Apart from 6, If you own any other smartphone, Its a bang for a buck and a truly amazing experience awaits if you switch. Well, I've upgraded from a 4-year-old Nexus 5 to 6t and boy am I impressed?
Build & Design
I was amazed by the truly bezel-less design and an amazing 6.4-inch screen. Fantastic design and build quality. Youtube videos are stunning at HD and if you are a gamer, this is the screen is for you! The notch. It's the best the technology could get close to acheive a bezel-less display. Trust me, It adds to the design and it's not odd at all.
Software
Better than stock! Say's the one who's been using stock for 4 years in a Nexus 5. Oxygen just fly. The speed you need!
In-display Fingerprint Sensor
It's true that the sensor learns your pattern over time. It got super fast over a period of time. I've turned off face unlock. The fingerprint sensor is just way too convenient as it's right where your thumb already is while you operate your phone.
Camera
I've attached a few sample images. Those are untouched and raw images. The primary camera is probably the best in the market (excluding Pixel). The images are crystal clear. Well, balanced colors. Portraits are great. DSLR quality images right out of our pocket. But pretty disappointed with the nightscape feature. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do. Other than that, The camera is simply awesome!
Battery
I get 26 hours with an average day to day usage on weekdays. Since I use it a bit more heavily on weekends, I get about 22 - 24 hours with a continuous screen time of 6-7 hours. Over and above the dash charger does the rest of the magic. 10 - 100% in just 1 hour.
Speakers
The bottom firing speakers are great for indoor music. But Oneplus could have look at the stereo option for the 6T. A little disappointment there.
Overall the 6T is worth every penny you spend. You are getting the best of everything at a reasonable price. The 6T will keep you on trend and updated at least for the next 2 years. Just go for it :)",Anshal,18 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Just Upgrade,"Just one word for the phone amazing!
The picture quality,the screen,the OS all are just amazing!
Battery life is Very good too.
You'll get 5.5-6+ hrs of screen on time with 4G on at all times from 100-15%.
With wifi maybe more.
Will last you a day easy if you're above 70%
Compare it with other phones no match at all!
If you've the money and want to buy a new phone, just go for this one!
I've seen the poco F1 too.. If you compare the price yes obviously it's cheaper, and if you don't feel like shelling out so much money go for the poco f1.
But trust me this just feels a lot different than other phones, be it apple, Samsung or any other brand,
The speakers are Little bit of a let down but they're not that bad too.
Rest I'll suggest instead of Shelling out One lakh on phones just save 60k and buy this phone, you'll never regret your decision.",Abhimaan G.,27 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Indisplay fingerprint scanner could take few more microseconds than standard fingerprint scanner, but still best in the segment.
Indisplay fingerprint scan lights up too much, might be bit annoying when using at night/first thing in Morning.

Performance beast!,"This is called a flagship killer! awesome performance. Been using it close to a month. The experience is brilliant. Flawless gaming experience. Battery is mind blowing. With a normal usage (4g, on wi-fi continuously, video watching, social media, normal gaming) battery lasts atleast 10-12hrs. Standby time i got was 2 days (i only used to make calls and some lite reading). worth every penny.
Only downsize is no 3.5mm jack (but they have provided an adapter in the box). Bullets earphone is worthless. sound clarity is very poor. So if you are planning to buy bullets (coz of all the hype), please don't. It's not worth it.

Excellent Mobile,"Battery life is awesome. On heavy usage battery will stand for a day. On minimal usage, battery will stands for easily 2 days. Apart from the DASH charging is awesome. To charge a whole 3700 MAH battery, charging takes around 1 hour 10 minutes. Thanks to DASH charging.
Picture quality - it is good when compared to Mobile at this prices ranga. Nightscape mode is good. Oxygen OS updates has been released to make the camera battery.
Sound Quality - it's good and can't expect more. Value for Money.
Final Tip. Don't compare the OnePlus 6T with Samsung Galaxy s9, Google pixel 3, Apple 8, X, XS. They are really very expensive when compared to OnePlus 6T. In this budget, OnePlus is the best available option. Bang for bucks.",Dinesh,29 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome in everything,This mobile is the best I have ever seen before... Picture quality and speed are awesome.. Sound is bit louder.

My first one plus and in love with it,After using it for a week! This is My first One plus mobile and I am really in love with this one. It's pure Android oxygen OS which gives you alot custom modifications. Camera is superb and sound quality is great with DiracHD. Finger print scanner is lit work like a charm.

Excellent phone with excellent speed.,"Battery life and speed of this phone are amazing. Picture quality is also very good, but picture quality at night is the only drawback with this phone. They have added Nightvision to the camera which is awesome, but even with that the noise in other picture modes at night is a concern. Again, the speed is just mind blowing and screen qualiy is sweet.",Chandan Akiti,13 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

An affordable Beast!!,"coming from the Samsung Note series, One plus felt like a complete refresh and a makeover. The software experience kept me hooked on all the time and got me addicted pretty quick. Even though the prices keep increasing I still feel its comparatively less expensive than the other flagships.
I got google camera installed and the results were just eye-opening, the one plus camera is still pretty good though.
The battery lasted me through the day with moderate to heavy usage so no issues there.
The display although not as good as the Samsung's, I felt it came pretty close.
I just feel the audio experience through the phone could've been better, hope an update improves things.
To put it simply, It a fabulous phone and a definite and comparatively affordable buy!",Chirag,28 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

"phone was hanged , Please don't buy it","Please note my comment this phone is really very pathetic and if the phone got hanged then you can't do anything , the power key was also won't work. The reason for sharing this review was yesterday I was launching the game app and phone was hanged for a long time and I tried to long press the power key button and took out the SIM but nothing won't work.This is really very disappointment for me and other end user. I have trusted on oneplus instead of Iphone , but the result is opposite. Finally, waste of money and time ,battery backup is also worst, launching the game app phone got hanged. In my point of view nothing is good as per my requirement.I was unable to uplad the video because of size issue.",suyash jain,29 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Super Snappy....,I have been using the device and it's super snappy... The night mode in camera does a decent job since some photos were not as good as the others clicked in the night mode.

Best in this price range!,Okay so writing this review after 5 days use. I'll keep it sweet & simple. Camera & Battery life are unbeatable. Even people go crazy after seeing the in-built fingerprint sensor & the teardrop notch design gives this thing a look you can't forget . Build quality is more than superb. Those who say that poco f1 has the same processor don't really know what they're talking about & these two devices are way apart & poco doesn't stand anywhere in competition to 6T.

not as expected,"First thing : I think amazon could have done better in delivering the product faster, i ordered it on November 1st and it arrived at the evening of November 5th,
Second : The phone overall is decent, but i feel like the battery is draining alot, after 1 and 1/2 hour of gaming, the battery dropped from 99% to 59%
Third : they can totally do better with their camera, its not what i expected from one plus
Foruth : Are the right side stereo speaker for show case or what? it doesnt work at all.
the left side is amazingly loud thou, but what kind of socery is this?",Aqdus Kamber,6 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Display doesn't work. WORST PHONE!!!!,"It has got to be the worst phone and worst company ever in the history of smart phone companies. Within 3 days of operating the phone, I started facing problems with the phone.
1. Unlock features malfunctioned. Double tap UNLOCK function started lagging.
2. Picture quality not up to the mark.
3. Phone started hanging.
4. TOUCH HAS COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING.
Since I was travelling I couldn't get my phone replaced within 10 days. But I reported the same and made a video. But according to the policies one plus can't do anything about it now.
I highly recommend not to buy this phone. Rather go for a Samsung or vivo or any other smart phone. In my experience it has got to be the worst in terms of quality and customer service.",zaid ahmed,19 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

Camera - 10/5(tooo gud)
Performance - super smooth
Design - extremely powerul design
Face and finger lock within seconds
Sound - double the sound of oneplus 5

I am not a very heavy user and seldom play games. I just use mobile in routine office works like calling,messaging, e-mailing and browsing. In addition, during leisure time I see you tube videos and listen songs. Sound quality is not very good but battery life for user like me seems ok.

DON'T BUY IT FROM AMAZON ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A OFFER RELATED TO IT.,"There was a offer where we had to pre-book the oneplus 6t by purchasing a gift card of rs 1000 which my brother purchased it for me by selecting the option of FROM- ""my brother's mail id"" to- ""my mail id"". And that's the abstract idea of a gift card to be gifted by someone to some other guy. I got my oneplus 6t. But i did not get the RS 500 cashback or type c bullet earphones just because i did not order the oneplus 6t from my brothers account who purchased it! So we had to purchase the phone from the account who purchased the gift card.

Never settle,One plus has been throwing phones at us which are a step better than the previous release. The OnePlus 6T lives up to it's brand name and the marketing. One of the best phones in the market which has given a head on challenge to to other more expensive phones with the same features. The picture quality is at par with what the customer expectations.

Worst customer service and terms,"The phone is absolutely fine. But its the Amazon which started to disrespect customers.
Initially they did all sorts of support to their customers, but now providing worst service.
I prebooked the phone on oct 15th bullet earphones offer, and as per the terms bought it on nov 2 ( despite having plently of launch offers on nov 1 ) i even confirmed with the customer care on having launch offer and pre booking offer. They told me to pick either one. So i decided prebooking headphones.
Now after 15 days they are telling am not eligible for prebookinh offers with silly reason.
Worst service and very disspointing.",Amazon Customer,17 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

On Screen FingerPrint Scanner is much slower and night mode camera is not worth,"The onscreen finger print scanner is much slower than the scanner at the back in earlier models. The night mode camera is not worth as it needs you to hold phone tight and it takes picture with higher time of exposure. The picture blurs.

Picture quality : 4.5/5. My friends who have iPhone X, take pictures in my OnePlus 6T.
Sound Quality : The only negative thing in OnePlus 6T. When you play a game or watch a video, you tend to cover the speaker which is at the bottom. Very badly engineered. You block the sound when you play games or watch videos
Battery life : Above average. I wouldn't say it's good. When I turn off Bluetooth, location and others, except Data, it lasts more than a day for me.",Vijay Kumar,22 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

Worth every penny,"I am using the OnePlus 6T for 2 weeks now and I must say it is an awesome phone. Battery life is great even with extensive usuage. Camera is excellent. If you like big screens you will definitely enjoy this almost bezel less screen. Audio is loud and clear. The face unlock uses your retina and it is seamless and fast each time at every angle. Good job there. Fingerprint scans super fast. Love the glossy mirror black back, came with a protective case in the box. Just be careful while you unbox the phone, make sure you sit on a bed or something. It tends to slip while unboxing.
I am enjoying my smart new device, it's perfect every way.",Parinitha,16 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars
Supreme Quality phone,Amazing phone. Superfast in multitasking. Good picture quality. Much better battery formance than OnePlus 6. Fast charging is just amazing it takes only 40 minutes to 100% charging and full day moderate usage. Call qualify is superb and even the data connectivity is too fast. In fingerprint scanner and face unlock are super fast. I bought wireless headsets so never missed 3.5 mm headphone jack. Just go for it.

Great phone for gamers,Enough of bad developers from MI. I hope OnePlus have good developers who will take care of hardware and software. Now it's fast enough to play games access application but sometimes it's getting crashed. Camera closing unusually. Hope will get update update with fixes. Finger print takes little more time compared to physical sensors. It tells that physical sensors is very fast in finger print enrollment and verification. My suggestion would be if the on screen sensor works normally it will be great to use. Now using face detection to unlock the device.,christober,20 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

The previous generation was already a fantastic phone, so does it really need an upgrade? Yes, if you are excited about the smaller notch, bigger screen, a bigger battery and better software.

ERA of One plus 6t 'The NEW BEAST',"The tagline is the perfect mark of the phone
I haven't experienced that much speed even in iPhone. I loved the dash charge feature, battery life , mirror black look gives the phone a sexier look .

False promises and Very Poor execution of Marketing Promotion,The shopping Experience on Amazon and for One Plus 6T was very disappointing since they make false marketing promotion and they marketed saying on the Prebooking if it is done with 1000 Rs gift card i would be getting a USB type earphone and Rs 500 Cashback received which was latter denied saying the gift card purchased and the account used for booking was different and pls note this was never mentioned on any email sent from amazon on the Gift card,Sijo,21 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars
Grip and Smudge free after skin,"The phone is totally value for money, the only thing which was a bit annoying about the OnePlus 6T Mirror Black variant was it was a bit slippery and a fingerprint/smudge magnet.

It gives video stabilization. It can shoot video in different formats like 4k,1080p,720p.It is working nicely. Gaming speed is also very good.

Buttery smooth and super powerful.. but.,This is the smoothest and most powerful out there that doesn't require a kidney for payment (yes apple). My only crib is with the form factor - tad bulky and doesn't feel as comfortable in hand as the 3t felt (previous phone) and from the back looks exactly the same like redmi note 5!!!

Design is also not much good. I can say that not at all stylish.

Amazon sucks and so do their products,Had bought this product under preorder sale but was denied free bullet headphone voucher from for reason whatsoever best known to them amazon sucks and so do their products pathetic customer support only robots sitting in their who just know to say sorry we can't help you on this .

Best oneplus phone till now.,Overall the phone is great. Although they should have considered keeping the headphone jack and 64 gb version. Also they should have made some in cameras also but it's good anyway. The in display fingerprint scanner was little slow earlier but its better now with the latest update. I hope that in the next version they include ultra sonic scanner rather than optical one that so that it will work even if the screen is turned off.,Ankit bhatt,11 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars

A beast of a phone if you are not an audiophile!!,Just the looks of my mirror glass finish is great. With the rear camera having OIS is something I am loving especially while taking videos. I play games for around an hour a day and the battery easily comes up to one and a half days. Oxygenos is smooth as always.

Worst Camera Phone.,"People who are planning to buy this phone here are some points you should consider before buying it.
Camera quality is worst, the colors are fake.
Its new Nightmode is not working properly ,it is spoiling images.
My old iphone 6s takes better picture than this DUAL LENSE oneplus 6t .
This phone lags even if it has 8gb Ram .
Fingerprint is slow .
Only Dash Charging is a nice feature",Rushabh pasalkar,15 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars

My First Android phone.,"After almost one month of use.
1. Battery life is the best feature, easily 2 days phone if you are moderate user.

3. Even though it's only having one speaker, it's loud and clear. (stereo speakers would have been better)
4. Picture quality is decent. Not the best.
5. Overall - Built quality is good and feel of the phone is good.
I will recommend.",Ren H.,29 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars

Must Buy If Looking For A New Phone,"One of the best phones out there, and that counts while putting it against the IOS devices. The battery just won't die and the screen resolution is unbelievable. So many features. In display finger print and face unlock are lighting fast. You don't really need an 8gb phone. 6 is more than enough. Camera quality is too good and night mode is another level.

Worst Camera,"I have used two days and phone is good with speed and multi tasking but camera is worst, it did not meet even a normal 10000 rupees phone camera feature.

However, their systems failed to record the time of purchase and as a result the free earphones that were to be dispatched to all One Plus 6t pre bookings were not sent to me.

Best Android phone around 40K,"After using for almost 20 days, I can say I am fully satisfied with 6T. This is best Android phone available in market & at this price is a catch.

Heating issue in phone after returning the 1st handset it persists.,If you buy this kind of product you expect it to be awesome.
